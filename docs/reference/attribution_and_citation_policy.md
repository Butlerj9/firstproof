  terminology, or conclusions from this project.

It is designed to maximize credit and provenance clarity even when formal
enforcement is limited.

## 2. Strongly requested scholarly practice

For any work that uses or adapts this repository's:
- methods/protocols,
- novel terminology and framing,
- empirical conclusions or synthesized findings,
- escalation structures and evaluation taxonomy,

please provide explicit citation and acknowledgment, even where strict copyright
obligations may not cover independent re-expression of ideas.

This request is policy-level (normative), not a separate legal license.

## 3. Preferred citation

Use one of:
- `CITATION.cff`
- `CITATION.bib`

Repository URL:
- https://github.com/Butlerj9/firstproof

## 4. Recommended acknowledgment text

For papers/reports:

> This work reuses methods and/or terminology from the First Proof repository
> (Butler, 2026), including its agentic gate protocol, escalation framework, and
> evidence-tier reporting conventions.

For benchmarks/tooling docs:

## 5. Reuse checklist (for downstream authors)

Before publication, verify that you have:
1. Cited the repository (`CITATION.cff` or `CITATION.bib`).
2. Included a license reference when reusing/adapting text/artifacts.
3. Marked adaptations or modifications.
4. Included a clear provenance note for reused methods/terminology/conclusions.

## 6. Unique terms and framing

If you reuse distinctive terms or framing introduced in this repository (for
example escalation taxonomy or resonance framing), please cite and acknowledge
origin explicitly.

This is especially important when those terms materially shape your analysis or
evaluation criteria.

## 7. Scope note
