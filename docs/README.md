# Docs Index

This folder provides a standard, navigable documentation layout for the project.
Canonical operational files remain at repo root for compatibility with existing runbooks and automation.

## Sections

- `docs/methods/README.md` — methodology, autonomy boundary, enforcement protocol, technical limitations, and future-work directions
- `docs/results/README.md` — consolidated outcomes and per-problem status artifacts
- `docs/reference/README.md` — runbooks, background context, and source-material references

## Attribution and citation

- `CITATION.cff` and `CITATION.bib` (preferred citation metadata)
- `NOTICE` (attribution notice)
- `docs/reference/attribution_and_citation_policy.md` (credit and reuse policy)

## Canonical file policy

- Root files remain canonical unless explicitly migrated:
  - `methods_extended.md`
  - `RESULTS.md`
  - `firstproof.md`
  - `firstproof_sprint_plan.md`
  - `CONTAMINATION.md`
