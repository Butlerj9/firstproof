# Audit: P08 — Lagrangian smoothing of polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces

## G0 Formalize

**Status**: ✅ Complete.

### Problem restatement

**Definitions**:
- A **polyhedral Lagrangian surface** K ⊂ R⁴ is a finite polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangian (with respect to the standard symplectic form ω = dx₁ ∧ dy₁ + dx₂ ∧ dy₂), and which is a topological submanifold of R⁴.
- A **Lagrangian smoothing** of K is a family {K_t}_{t ∈ (0,1]} of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds of R⁴, which extends to a topological isotopy {K_t}_{t ∈ [0,1]} with K₀ = K, where the isotopy is **Hamiltonian** (i.e., generated by a Hamiltonian vector field).

**Hypothesis**: K is a polyhedral Lagrangian surface with exactly **4 faces meeting at every vertex**.

**Question**: Does K necessarily have a Lagrangian smoothing?

### Object glossary

| Symbol | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| R⁴ | Symplectic manifold | Standard symplectic structure ω = dx₁∧dy₁ + dx₂∧dy₂ |
| Lagrangian face | 2-dimensional face | A polygon in R⁴ lying in a Lagrangian plane (ω|_face = 0) |
| Polyhedral Lagrangian surface K | Polyhedral 2-complex in R⁴ | All faces Lagrangian, topological 2-manifold |
| 4-valent vertex | Vertex condition | Exactly 4 faces meet at each vertex |
| Lagrangian smoothing | Deformation | Hamiltonian isotopy K_t of smooth Lagrangians, converging topologically to K as t→0 |
| Hamiltonian isotopy | Isotopy class | Generated by Hamiltonian vector field X_H where ι_{X_H}ω = dH |
| Liouville form λ | 1-form on R⁴ | λ = y₁ dx₁ + y₂ dx₂, satisfying dλ = ω |
| Exact Lagrangian | Lagrangian L | λ|_L is exact (all periods vanish) |

### Key mathematical structure

1. **Lagrangian planes in R⁴**: A 2-plane Π ⊂ R⁴ is Lagrangian iff ω|_Π = 0. The Lagrangian Grassmannian Λ(2) ≅ U(2)/O(2) is 3-dimensional.

2. **Vertex condition**: At each vertex, 4 Lagrangian faces meet. The local model near a vertex is a cone over 4 arcs on S³. The 4 faces span (at most) 4 Lagrangian planes through the vertex.

3. **Why 4 faces matters**: For a polyhedral surface in R⁴, the generic vertex valence depends on the codimension. In R³ (codimension 1), 3 faces meeting at a vertex is generic. In R⁴ (codimension 2), 4 faces at a vertex appears generic for Lagrangian surfaces.

4. **Smoothing = resolving vertices**: At each vertex, the 4 Lagrangian faces need to be "rounded" into a smooth Lagrangian. This is a local-to-global problem: local smoothings must be compatible and the result must be Hamiltonian isotopic to K.

5. **Comparison**: For Lagrangian surgery in symplectic topology, the standard construction resolves transverse intersections of two Lagrangians. At a vertex with 4 faces, the situation is more complex.

6. **Abouzaid connection**: Mohammed Abouzaid (first author of the paper) is a leading figure in symplectic topology, particularly Lagrangian Floer theory and homological mirror symmetry. This problem likely comes from his research.

### Truth mode

- [x] EXPLORE BOTH (50% YES / 50% NO)
- YES lean: The 4-valent condition is a natural genericity condition. In analogy with tropical geometry (where tropical curves smooth to algebraic curves), polyhedral Lagrangians with generic combinatorics should smooth.
- NO lean: There may be a global obstruction (e.g., a Maslov class obstruction, or a moduli obstruction) that prevents smoothing even when local smoothings exist. With 4 faces per vertex, there could be a topological/combinatorial constraint that creates such an obstruction.

### Counterexample shape

- **NO evidence**: Exhibit a specific polyhedral Lagrangian K with 4 faces at each vertex, and show that no smooth Lagrangian can be C⁰-close to K (e.g., using Lagrangian intersection theory, Maslov index, or Floer-theoretic invariants).
- **YES evidence**: Give a general construction that smooths any such K, or reduce to known results about tropical Lagrangians.

### Experiment plan

| Phase | Task | Pass/Fail |
|-------|------|-----------|
| EXP-1 | Construct polyhedral Lagrangian octahedron (S²) with 4-valent vertices | ✅ PASS — all checks |
| EXP-2 | Verify action-value obstruction (Liouville integral = 0 on all cycles) | ✅ PASS — all zeros |

## G1 Background

**Status**: ✅ Sufficient (Gromov's theorem + action invariance only).

### Critical external dependencies

| Reference | Status | Need | Blocking? |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------|
| Gromov (1985), "Pseudo holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds" | ✅ Known at statement level | No closed exact Lagrangian in R⁴ | **Used in proof** |
| McDuff–Salamon, "Introduction to Symplectic Topology" | ✅ Known at statement level | Action invariance under Hamiltonian isotopy | **Used in proof** |
| Abouzaid–Smith, tropical Lagrangian geometry | ❌ Not sourced | Context only (§6 of answer) | No — not needed |
| Matessi (2019), "Lagrangian pairs of pants" | ❌ Not sourced | Context only | No — not needed |
| Mikhalkin (2019), "Examples of tropical-to-Lagrangian correspondence" | ❌ Not sourced | Context only | No — not needed |

### Known facts used in proof

1. **Gromov's theorem (1985)**: There is no closed exact Lagrangian submanifold in (R^{2n}, ω_std). For surfaces in R⁴: any smooth closed Lagrangian L with H¹(L; R) = 0 would be exact, hence impossible. This applies directly to S².

2. **Action invariance**: For Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms φ, the Liouville periods ∫_{φ(γ)} λ = ∫_γ λ|_L are invariant. Proof via Cartan's formula (see §4 of answer).

3. **Arzelà–Ascoli**: Bounded families of Lipschitz curves in R⁴ have convergent subsequences.

4. **Simple connectivity of S²**: π₁(S²) = 0, so every closed curve bounds a 2-chain.

## G2 Route Map

**Status**: ✅ Route C (obstruction search) succeeded.

### Route A: Tropical-Lagrangian correspondence (YES direction) — NOT USED

**Blocked** at step 1: not all polyhedral Lagrangians come from tropical curves. Our counterexample (octahedron ≅ S²) is genus 0, which never arises from tropical curves.

### Route B: Local surgery + patching (YES direction) — NOT USED

Irrelevant once counterexample found.

### Route C: Obstruction search (NO direction) — **SUCCEEDED**

1. **Key insight**: The simplest 4-valent polyhedron (octahedron) is homeomorphic to S², not a torus. Since S² is simply connected, the Gromov obstruction (no exact Lagrangian) applies.

2. **Construction**: Placed 6 vertices in R⁴ solving 8 linear Lagrangian conditions. Found 1-parameter family of solutions.

3. **Proof**: Combined action invariance + Arzelà–Ascoli convergence + Gromov. Works even if smoothing changes topology.

### Route D: Explicit construction (used for counterexample)

The octahedron IS the simplest 4-valent polyhedron. Constructed and verified computationally.

## G3–G5: Lemma DAG, Experiments, Proof Draft

**G3**: Lemma DAG is simple:
- Lemma 1: Lagrangian octahedron exists (EXP-1)
- Lemma 2: Action invariance under Hamiltonian isotopy (standard)
- Lemma 3: Every cycle on S² bounds a Lagrangian 2-chain → zero Liouville period (EXP-2)
- Theorem: Combine Lemmas 1–3 + Gromov → NO

**G4**: Experiments pass (see below).

**G5**: Proof draft complete in answer.md.

## G6: Review

### External Codex G6 (2026-02-11): original REJECT

1. **MAJOR — Step 2/5 regularity gap** (original Hausdorff-only limit argument).
2. **MAJOR — Definition mismatch** (answer.md Hausdorff vs audit.md topological isotopy).
3. **PASS — Construction/experiment side** (octahedron + Lagrangian checks reproducible).

### G6 Patch (2026-02-11): ACCEPT

**Resolution**: Adopted topology-preserving (topological triviality) definition consistently across both artifacts. This is the standard meaning of "smoothing" in symplectic geometry. Under this definition:

- Smoothing extends continuously to $t=0$, forcing $K_t \cong K \cong S^2$ for all $t > 0$.
- Any smooth compact Lagrangian $S^2$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$ is exact ($H^1(S^2) = 0$).
- Gromov's theorem gives immediate contradiction.

The entire 7-step limit argument is eliminated. The proof is now 3 steps with no regularity hypothesis. The old limit argument is preserved in Appendix A of answer.md for completeness.

**MAJOR #1**: Resolved — limit argument no longer needed.
**MAJOR #2**: Resolved — definitions now aligned (topology-preserving in both files).
