# Audit: P08 — Lagrangian smoothing of polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces

## G0 Formalize

**Status**: ✅ Complete.

### Problem restatement

**Definitions**:
- A **polyhedral Lagrangian surface** K ⊂ R⁴ is a finite polyhedral complex all of whose faces are Lagrangian (with respect to the standard symplectic form ω = dx₁ ∧ dy₁ + dx₂ ∧ dy₂), and which is a topological submanifold of R⁴.
- A **Lagrangian smoothing** of K is a family {K_t}_{t ∈ (0,1]} of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds of R⁴, which extends to a topological isotopy {K_t}_{t ∈ [0,1]} with K₀ = K, where the isotopy is **Hamiltonian** (i.e., generated by a Hamiltonian vector field).

**Hypothesis**: K is a polyhedral Lagrangian surface with exactly **4 faces meeting at every vertex**.

**Question**: Does K necessarily have a Lagrangian smoothing?

### Object glossary

| Symbol | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| R⁴ | Symplectic manifold | Standard symplectic structure ω = dx₁∧dy₁ + dx₂∧dy₂ |
| Lagrangian face | 2-dimensional face | A polygon in R⁴ lying in a Lagrangian plane (ω|_face = 0) |
| Polyhedral Lagrangian surface K | Polyhedral 2-complex in R⁴ | All faces Lagrangian, topological 2-manifold |
| 4-valent vertex | Vertex condition | Exactly 4 faces meet at each vertex |
| Lagrangian smoothing | Deformation | Hamiltonian isotopy K_t of smooth Lagrangians, converging topologically to K as t→0 |
| Hamiltonian isotopy | Isotopy class | Generated by Hamiltonian vector field X_H where ι_{X_H}ω = dH |

### Key mathematical structure

1. **Lagrangian planes in R⁴**: A 2-plane Π ⊂ R⁴ is Lagrangian iff ω|_Π = 0. The Lagrangian Grassmannian Λ(2) ≅ U(2)/O(2) is 3-dimensional.

2. **Vertex condition**: At each vertex, 4 Lagrangian faces meet. The local model near a vertex is a cone over 4 arcs on S³. The 4 faces span (at most) 4 Lagrangian planes through the vertex.

3. **Why 4 faces matters**: For a polyhedral surface in R⁴, the generic vertex valence depends on the codimension. In R³ (codimension 1), 3 faces meeting at a vertex is generic. In R⁴ (codimension 2), 4 faces at a vertex appears generic for Lagrangian surfaces.

4. **Smoothing = resolving vertices**: At each vertex, the 4 Lagrangian faces need to be "rounded" into a smooth Lagrangian. This is a local-to-global problem: local smoothings must be compatible and the result must be Hamiltonian isotopic to K.

5. **Comparison**: For Lagrangian surgery in symplectic topology, the standard construction resolves transverse intersections of two Lagrangians. At a vertex with 4 faces, the situation is more complex.

6. **Abouzaid connection**: Mohammed Abouzaid (first author of the paper) is a leading figure in symplectic topology, particularly Lagrangian Floer theory and homological mirror symmetry. This problem likely comes from his research.

### Truth mode

- [x] EXPLORE BOTH (50% YES / 50% NO)
- YES lean: The 4-valent condition is a natural genericity condition. In analogy with tropical geometry (where tropical curves smooth to algebraic curves), polyhedral Lagrangians with generic combinatorics should smooth.
- NO lean: There may be a global obstruction (e.g., a Maslov class obstruction, or a moduli obstruction) that prevents smoothing even when local smoothings exist. With 4 faces per vertex, there could be a topological/combinatorial constraint that creates such an obstruction.

### Counterexample shape

- **NO evidence**: Exhibit a specific polyhedral Lagrangian K with 4 faces at each vertex, and show that no smooth Lagrangian can be C⁰-close to K (e.g., using Lagrangian intersection theory, Maslov index, or Floer-theoretic invariants).
- **YES evidence**: Give a general construction that smooths any such K, or reduce to known results about tropical Lagrangians.

### Experiment plan

| EXP-1 | Classify local models: at a vertex with 4 Lagrangian faces in R⁴, what are the possible configurations? | Classified → PASS |
| EXP-2 | Check: does the standard Lagrangian surgery handle the 4-face vertex? | Yes → strong YES signal |
| EXP-3 | Construct simplest example: 4 Lagrangian triangles meeting at a point in R⁴ | Explicit → PASS |
| EXP-4 | Check for Maslov/topological obstructions in the simplest example | No obstruction → YES signal |

### Known facts (without references)

1. **Lagrangian surgery**: Given two Lagrangians L₁, L₂ intersecting transversally at a point p, one can perform Lagrangian surgery to produce a new Lagrangian L₁ # L₂. This is a local construction near p.

2. **Tropical geometry connection**: Tropical varieties (piecewise-linear objects) are expected to correspond to actual algebraic/Lagrangian objects under a limiting process. Mikhalkin and others have made this precise in various settings.

3. **Maslov class**: For a Lagrangian L ⊂ R⁴ (or more generally in a Calabi-Yau), the Maslov class μ ∈ H¹(L; Z) is an obstruction to grading. For smoothing, one needs the Maslov class of K (defined combinatorially) to be consistent.

4. **Polyhedral Lagrangians in tropical geometry**: A tropical curve in R² gives (via the moment map) a Lagrangian surface in (C*)². The "coamoeba" or "Lagrangian lift" is piecewise Lagrangian. Smoothing tropical curves corresponds to smoothing these Lagrangian lifts.

5. **4-valence = trivalent tropical curve**: In tropical geometry, a trivalent curve in R² has vertex valence 3 (in the tropical sense). The Lagrangian lift of a trivalent vertex gives a vertex with 4 Lagrangian faces (the extra dimension comes from the T²-fiber direction). So "4 faces at every vertex" may be the Lagrangian analog of the tropical trivalency condition, which IS the generic smoothable case.

### Assessment

The problem connects polyhedral/tropical geometry with symplectic topology. The key insight (item 5 above) suggests that 4-valent polyhedral Lagrangian vertices correspond to trivalent tropical vertices, which are known to be smoothable in tropical geometry. The question is whether this smoothing can be done in the Lagrangian category.

This problem is **more tractable** than P02, P05, or P07 because:
- The objects are concrete (polyhedra in R⁴)
- The local model is computable
- There's a clear connection to tropical geometry
- Experimental verification via explicit construction is feasible

**However**: 2+ critical references blocked (Abouzaid–Smith, Matessi). The smoothing construction likely requires the specific techniques from these papers.

**Blocked items**: 2 of 6 critically needed.

## G2 Route Map

**Status**: ✅ Routes identified; execution partially feasible.

### Route A: Tropical-Lagrangian correspondence (YES direction, most promising)

1. Show that any 4-valent polyhedral Lagrangian K can be viewed as a tropical Lagrangian lift.
2. Apply tropical-to-Lagrangian smoothing results (Mikhalkin, Matessi) to get a smooth Lagrangian.
3. Verify the smoothing is Hamiltonian.

**Bottleneck**: Step 1 — not all polyhedral Lagrangians come from tropical curves. Step 2 requires reference access.

### Route B: Local surgery + patching (YES direction)

1. At each 4-valent vertex, perform local Lagrangian surgery to smooth the vertex.
2. Show that local smoothings can be patched along edges.
3. Show the resulting smooth Lagrangian is Hamiltonian isotopic to K.

**Bottleneck**: Step 2 — patching may introduce global obstructions. Step 3 requires Hamiltonian isotopy technology.

### Route C: Obstruction search (NO direction)

1. Compute Maslov index/class for simple polyhedral Lagrangians with 4-valent vertices.
2. If the Maslov class is nonzero in a way that prevents smooth representatives, get a NO signal.
3. Alternatively, look for Floer-theoretic obstructions.

**Assessment**: Less likely to succeed — the 4-valent condition seems designed to AVOID obstructions.

### Route D: Explicit construction for simplest examples

1. Build the simplest 4-valent polyhedral Lagrangian: a "square" (4 faces, 4 vertices, each 4-valent).
2. This should be a torus — check if it's Lagrangian.
3. Smooth it explicitly.

**Feasibility**: This could be done computationally. A polyhedral torus in R⁴ with Lagrangian faces could be constructed from 4 Lagrangian rectangles.

## Decision: ❌ PARK (with MEDIUM tractability note)

**Rationale**:
- 2+ critical references blocked (Abouzaid–Smith, Matessi).
- The problem is MEDIUM tractability — more concrete than P02/P05/P07, but the symplectic smoothing construction requires specialized techniques.
- Route D (explicit construction) is feasible but would require significant computation (~30-50 messages).
- The tropical-Lagrangian connection (Route A) is the most promising but needs references.
- Given sprint constraints, park now.

**Tractability ranking** (among parked problems):
1. P08 (MEDIUM) — concrete objects, computable local models
2. P07 (MEDIUM-LOW) — accessible concepts, but needs deep surgery theory
3. P02 (LOW) — highly specialized automorphic forms
4. P05 (LOW) — highly specialized equivariant homotopy, open-ended formulation
