# Contamination Log

## Policy
- No browsing of claimed solutions to numbered First Proof questions
- No searching "[author name] + [problem keywords]"
- All web searches logged below
- If accidental exposure occurs: freeze problem, log here, do NOT incorporate
- External scout model API calls are allowed for independent reasoning checks, but do not include retrieval of known solutions.
- For llm-only tracks, avoid web-searching foundational lemmas unless the run is explicitly marked as a relaxed-constraints pass.
