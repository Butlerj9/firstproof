## G2 Route Map Construction

### Novel constructions (PROVE_INLINE)

1. **O-dimension function**: ν_O(H) = max{|H:K| : K ≤_O H}. Generalizes |H| to a transfer-system-dependent quantity.

2. **O-slice filtration (Candidate A)**: τ_{≥n}^O generated by O-cells G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ind_K^H(1)} with k|H:K| ≥ n.

3. **O-slice characterization**: Φ^H(E) is ⌈n/ν_O(H)⌉-connective for all H ≤ G.

### Calibration tests

| Test | Transfer system | Expected | Got | Pass? |
|------|----------------|----------|-----|-------|
| Complete, G = Z/2 | {1→Z/2, Z/2→Z/2} | ν_O(Z/2)=2, standard HY | ν_O(Z/2)=2, ⌈n/2⌉ | PASS |
| Trivial, G = Z/2 | {Z/2→Z/2} | ν_O(H)=1, Postnikov | ν_O(Z/2)=1, n-conn for all H | PASS |
| Complete, G = Z/p | {1→Z/p, Z/p→Z/p} | ν_O(Z/p)=p | ν_O(Z/p)=p | PASS |

### Identified proof gaps

1. "Only if" orbit-counting: need to show Φ^L on generators has sufficient connectivity.
2. "If" direction: equivariant Whitehead argument for O-cells.
3. Candidates A vs B: whether they generate the same localizing subcategory.

## Supervisor return format

1. **Proved inline**: ν_O dimension function well-definedness; calibration at 3 test cases.
2. **Cited (statement-level, with labels)**: BH Def 3.7/3.22/4.3, Thm 3.24; Rubin Def 2.1/3.4, Thm 3.7, Cor 3.9; HY Def 1.1/2.6, Thm 2.5.
3. **Empirical**: None (no computation lane for this problem).
4. **Remaining blockers**: Proof of characterization (both directions); A vs B equivalence.
5. **Decision**: **PROCEED** (🟡 Candidate). Definition block resolved; 2 calibrated routes available.
6. **Messages used**: ~8 this cycle; estimated tokens: ~15K input + ~8K output.

## Reconstruction note

Session 1 detailed prompt/response history was not preserved. Sessions 5 and 6 are documented above.

## Session 6: Methods/Documentation Governance (repo-wide)

### Important prompts and responses

| Producer prompt | Supervisor response | Artifact impact |
|---|---|---|
| "Fix title, polish it for publication, and align the other documents." | Applied requested abstract/intro language and provenance constraints. | `methods_extended.md` |
| "Did you streamline README and reference extended methods?" | Reduced autonomy block to concise summary + explicit methods pointer. | `README.md`, `RESULTS.md` |
| "We should have a docs folder with standard filenames..." | Added docs index and methods/results/reference entrypoints while leaving root canonicals in place. | `docs/README.md`, `docs/methods/README.md`, `docs/results/README.md`, `docs/reference/README.md` |
| "Update transcript and audit documents with important prompts/responses." | Added non-math governance event entries for active unsolved lanes. | `P03/*`, `P05/*`, `P09/*` |

### Classification

- Type: ADMIN/LOGISTICS
- Mathematical impact: none
