nu_O^eff(1) = 1
nu_O^eff(H1) = 2
nu_O^eff(H2) = 1
nu_O^eff(H3) = 2
nu_O^eff(G) = 2

--- CHARACTERIZATION TARGET ---
E in tau_{>=n}^O iff:
  Phi^1(E) is ceil(n/1) = n-connective
  Phi^{H1}(E) is ceil(n/2)-connective
  Phi^{H2}(E) is ceil(n/1) = n-connective
  Phi^{H3}(E) is ceil(n/2)-connective
  Phi^G(E) is ceil(n/2)-connective

Note: H2 needs n-connective (not n/2) because nu_O^eff(H2) = 1.
H1 and H3 get n/2 because they have nu_O^eff = 2.
G gets n/2 because nu_O^eff(G) = 2.

--- KEY STRUCTURAL FEATURES ---
1. O-cell generators:
   At H1: G_+ ^_{H1} S^{k rho_{H1}} with 2k >= n (regular)
   At H3: G_+ ^_{H3} S^{k rho_{H3}} with 2k >= n (regular)
   At G:  S^{kV} with V=ind_{H2}^G(1), 2k >= n (non-regular)
   NO cells at H2 (1 <=_O H2 not in O)

2. V = ind_{H2}^G(1) = 1 + chi where chi = sign character for G/H2
   chi^{H2} = C (trivial, since H2 = ker(chi)), so dim(chi^{H2}) = 1
   chi^{H1} = 0 (H1 not in ker(chi)), chi^{H3} = 0 (H3 not in ker(chi))
   chi^G = 0
   BUT WAIT: V^{H2} has dim 2 (not 1), so bar{V}^{H2} = 1 (not 0)!
   This means the geometric triviality lemma does NOT trivialize S^{bar{V}} at H2.

3. Isotropy separation at G:
   EP_{G,+} ^ E -> E -> tilde{EP}_G ^ E
   tilde{EP}_G-local part: geom triviality works (bar{V}^G = 0)
   Proper part: EP_{G,+} ^ E supported on H1, H2, H3

4. THE OBSTRUCTION:
   For the proper part, need EP_{G,+} ^ E in tau_{>=n}^O.
   Phi^{H2}(EP_{G,+} ^ E) = Phi^{H2}(E), which is n-connective (OK).
   But we also need to build it from O-cells.
   The O-cells at G level are S^{kV}, whose proper part EP ^ S^{kV}
   has Phi^{H2} = S^{2k} (since dim(V^{H2})=2), which is only 2k >= n.
   So actually... S^{kV} with 2k >= n already has Phi^{H2} >= n. This is fine!

5. REVISED ANALYSIS:
   The proper part lives on the family {1, H1, H2, H3}.
   At H1: Phi^{H1}(EP ^ E) = Phi^{H1}(E), ceil(n/2)-connective
   At H2: Phi^{H2}(EP ^ E) = Phi^{H2}(E), n-connective
   At H3: Phi^{H3}(EP ^ E) = Phi^{H3}(E), ceil(n/2)-connective
   At G: Phi^G(EP ^ E) = 0 (infinitely connective)

   Need: EP_{G,+} ^ E in tau_{>=n}^O.
   tau_{>=n}^O restricted to proper part: generated by
     G_+ ^_{H1} S^{k rho_{H1}} (proper part thereof) and
     G_+ ^_{H3} S^{k rho_{H3}} (proper part thereof) and
     EP ^ S^{kV} (proper part of G-level cells)
