## 1. Problem statement

Fix a finite group $G$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an $N_\infty$ operad. Define the slice filtration on the $G$-equivariant stable category adapted to $\mathcal{O}$ and state and prove a characterization of the $\mathcal{O}$-slice connectivity of a connective $G$-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

## 3. Answer: Two candidate O-adapted definitions + characterizations

### 3.1. Key construction: O-dimension function

For a transfer system $\mathcal{O}$ on $G$ (viewed as a partial order on $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$), define the **$\mathcal{O}$-dimension function** $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}: \mathrm{Sub}(G) \to \mathbb{N}$ by:

$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max\{|H:K| \;:\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$$

where $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ means there is an $\mathcal{O}$-transfer from $K$ to $H$, implying $K \subseteq H$.

**Properties**:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq 1$ always ($H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ by reflexivity).
- For the **complete** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H|$ (since $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ for all $H$).
- For the **trivial** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = 1$ (only $H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$).
- Well-defined and conjugation-invariant (by closure properties of transfer systems).

### 3.2. Candidate A: O-slice filtration via O-cells

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration)**. Define $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ to be the localizing subcategory of genuine $G$-spectra generated by:

$$\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_{K}^{H}(\mathbf{1})} \;:\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H, \; H \leq G, \; k \cdot |H:K| \geq n\}$$

where $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ is the permutation representation of $H$ on $H/K$.

**Characterization (Candidate A)**. A connective $G$-spectrum $E$ is $\mathcal{O}$-slice $n$-connective (i.e., $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$) if and only if:

$$\Phi^H(E) \text{ is } \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil\text{-connective for all } H \leq G.$$

**Calibration**:
- Complete transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H|$, recovers $\lceil n/|H| \rceil$ (Hill-Yarnall Thm 2.5). PASS.
- Trivial transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = 1$, gives $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H$. This is the naive/orbit-wise Postnikov baseline (no norms available, connectivity is measured orbit-by-orbit). PASS.
- For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$: there are exactly 2 transfer systems (complete and trivial), and Candidate A interpolates correctly between the two. PASS.

**Bottleneck for proof**: Need to establish that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is indeed a localizing subcategory (closure under extensions and filtered colimits), and that the geometric fixed-point characterization holds. The "only if" direction reduces to computing $\Phi^H$ on generators. The "if" direction requires showing that the $\Phi^H$-connectivity condition implies membership in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, which typically uses a Postnikov-type induction on the orbit filtration.

### 3.3. Candidate B: O-slice filtration via O-regular representation

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-regular representation)**. For $H \leq G$, define the $\mathcal{O}$-regular representation recursively:
- $\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathrm{ind}_{K_{\min}}^H(\mathbf{1})$, where $K_{\min}$ is the minimal $\mathcal{O}$-transferable subgroup of $H$ (i.e., the smallest $K$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$).
- $\dim(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}) = |H:K_{\min}| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H)$.

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration)**. $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the localizing subcategory generated by $\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} : H \leq G, \; k \cdot \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq n\}$.

**Characterization (Candidate B)**: Same as Candidate A (same dimension function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$).

**Key difference from A**: Candidate B uses a single "canonical" representation per orbit $G/H$, while Candidate A uses all representations from O-admissible inductions. This matters when there are multiple minimal transferable subgroups.

**Bottleneck**: When $H$ has multiple incomparable $\mathcal{O}$-minimal subgroups, $K_{\min}$ is not unique, so $\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}$ depends on a choice. This makes Candidate A more canonical.

### 3.4. Comparison and recommendation

| Feature | Candidate A | Candidate B |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Generator set | All O-admissible inductions | Single canonical rep per orbit |
| Choice-free? | YES | NO (when multiple minimals) |
| Calibration (complete) | PASS | PASS |
| Calibration (trivial) | PASS | PASS |
| Proof difficulty | Moderate (larger generator set) | Moderate (canonical but may miss cells) |

**Recommendation**: **Candidate A** is preferred because it is choice-free and naturally incorporates all $\mathcal{O}$-structure. The characterization theorem has the same statement for both.

### 3.5. Proof sketch for Candidate A

**Claim**: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ if and only if $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**"Only if" direction**: It suffices to check the characterization on generators. For a generator $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $k|H:K| \geq n$:
- $\Phi^L(G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot |(gH/gK)^{L \cap gHg^{-1}}|}$
- The fixed-point dimension $|(H/K)^{L'}|$ (with $L' = L \cap gHg^{-1}$) gives connectivity $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}|$.
- We need $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}| \geq \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ for all $L$ and all double coset representatives $g$.

**"Only if" — obstruction for intermediate transfer systems (Session 7)**: The inequality $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}| \geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ FAILS for certain intermediate transfer systems on groups with $\geq 3$ subgroups. Counterexample:

- $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, transfer system $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$ (transfers at the bottom level only).
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$ (no proper transfer into $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$).
- Generator: $G_+ \wedge_{\mathbb{Z}/p} S^{k\rho}$ with $\rho = \mathrm{ind}_1^{\mathbb{Z}/p}(\mathbf{1})$ (regular rep of $\mathbb{Z}/p$), $k \cdot p \geq n$.
- $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}$: single double coset ($G$ abelian), $L' = \mathbb{Z}/p$, $\dim(\rho^{\mathbb{Z}/p}) = 1$.
- Connectivity at $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$: $k \cdot 1 = k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil$.
- Required: $k \geq \lceil n/1 \rceil = n$ (since $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$).
- But $k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil < n$ for $p \geq 2$, $n > 1$. **FAILS.**

**Consequence**: The characterization $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective is NOT valid as the "only if" direction for Candidate A's generators with arbitrary $(H, K)$ pairs. The generator set is too permissive: $\mathcal{O}$-cells from intermediate subgroups $H$ can have coarser connectivity at larger subgroups $L > H$ than the characterization demands.

**Valid special cases**: The characterization IS correct for:
- $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (only 2 subgroups; no intermediate transfer systems exist). Both the complete and trivial systems reduce to known results (HY Thm 2.5 and Postnikov respectively).
- The **complete** transfer system on any $G$: reduces to HY Thm 2.5 (verified by construction).
- The **trivial** transfer system on any $G$: reduces to orbit-wise Postnikov (verified by construction).

**Possible fixes**:
1. **Restrict the generator set**: Only allow generators from $(H, K)$ where $K$ achieves the maximum index $|H:K| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H)$ at ALL subgroups simultaneously (essentially Candidate B). This shrinks $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.
2. **Modify the characterization**: Replace $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ with a more refined dimension function that accounts for the interaction between $\mathcal{O}$-transfers at different levels.
3. **Use a different definition of O-slice filtration**: Define $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ using generators $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}$ with $k \cdot \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq n$ AND the additional constraint $k \geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ for all $L \leq G$ such that $H$ is subconjugate to $L$.

Option 3 is the most conservative but potentially circular. The correct fix likely involves defining an "effective O-dimension function" that tracks the minimum fixed-point dimension across all subgroups.

**"If" direction**: Standard argument via the equivariant Whitehead theorem adapted to the $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells. If $\Phi^H(E)$ is sufficiently connective for all $H$, then $E$ can be built from $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells by a Postnikov-type construction.
- **Gap**: Requires showing the $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells detect all equivalences, i.e., that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the right localizing subcategory.
- **Note**: The "if" direction is independent of the "only if" obstruction above — it concerns the converse implication.

## 5. What is defined vs unresolved

**Defined (this cycle)**:
- $\mathcal{O}$-dimension function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max\{|H:K| : K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$
- $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration (two candidates, A preferred)
- Characterization statement: $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H$

**Unresolved**:
1. **"If" direction of the corrected characterization**: For intermediate $\mathcal{O}$ on groups with $|G| \geq p^2$, the converse — $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connectivity implies $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ — remains conjectured. Session 10 analysis (§7) shows this is a genuinely new technical result: three proof approaches are blocked, no counterexample was found, and the structural gap (t-structure for O-cells, RO(G)-graded Whitehead for non-regular reps) goes beyond existing machinery.
2. **Uniqueness of O-slice filtration**: Whether Candidates A and B generate the same localizing subcategory when multiple O-minimal subgroups exist. The counterexample in §3.5 suggests they may NOT coincide for intermediate systems.
3. **t-structure question**: Whether $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the left half of a t-structure on $\mathrm{Sp}^G$. This is identified in §7.1 as the key structural question whose resolution would likely settle the "if" direction.

## 6. Formal results (Session 8)

### Theorem 1 (Obstruction for intermediate transfer systems)

**Statement**: Let $G$ be a finite group with a subgroup chain $1 < K < H < G$ such that $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ (i.e., $K$ transfers to $H$) but $H \not\leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ (i.e., $H$ does NOT transfer to $G$) and no other proper subgroup of $G$ is $\mathcal{O}$-transferable to $G$. Then the "only if" direction of the characterization "$E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \Rightarrow \Phi^G(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(G) \rceil$-connective" FAILS.

**Proof**:

Since $H \not\leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ and only $G \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ (reflexivity), we have $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(G) = 1$, so the characterization demands $\Phi^G(E)$ is $n$-connective.

Consider the generator $E_0 = G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$. By construction $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$, so $E_0 \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

Apply $\Phi^G$ to $E_0$. By the double coset formula:
$$\Phi^G(G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot V}) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in G \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot \dim(V^{G \cap gHg^{-1}})}$$
where $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ has $\dim V = |H:K|$.

The fixed-point dimension $\dim(V^{G \cap gHg^{-1}})$ counts the number of cosets $hK$ fixed by the subgroup $G \cap gHg^{-1}$ acting on $H/K$. When $G$ is abelian (as in $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$), this gives $\dim(V^H) = |\{hK : H \subseteq hKh^{-1}\}|$. Since $K < H$ and $K$ is normal in $H$ for the cyclic case, $\dim(V^H) = 1$ (only the coset $K$ itself is fixed).

Therefore $\Phi^G(E_0)$ has connectivity $k \cdot 1 = k$. Since $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$, we get $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil$. For $|H:K| \geq 2$ and $n > 1$: $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil < n$, contradicting the required $n$-connectivity.

**Concrete instance**: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $K = 1$, $H = \mathbb{Z}/p$, $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$. Then $|H:K| = p$, $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$, and $k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil < n$ for $p \geq 2$, $n > 1$. $\square$

### Theorem 2 (Positive scope: complete and trivial transfer systems)

**Statement**: For any finite group $G$:
- (a) **Complete transfer system**: The characterization holds. $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/|H| \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.
- (b) **Trivial transfer system**: The characterization holds. $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**Proof of (a)**: For the complete transfer system, $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ for all $K \leq H$, so $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max_{K \leq H} |H:K| = |H:1| = |H|$. The generator set of $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ includes all $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $K \leq H$ and $k|H:K| \geq n$. In particular, taking $K = 1$ gives $\mathrm{ind}_1^H(\mathbf{1}) = \rho_H$ (the regular representation). So $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ contains all generators of the standard slice filtration $\tau_{\geq n}$. Conversely, every $\mathcal{O}_{\max}$-generator is a wedge summand of a standard generator (since $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1}) \hookrightarrow \rho_H$ as representations). Therefore $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}} = \tau_{\geq n}$, and the characterization reduces to Hill-Yarnall Theorem 2.5 (§2.7, CITE_ONLY). $\square$

**Proof of (b)**: For the trivial transfer system, only $H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ (reflexivity). So $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H:H| = 1$ for all $H$. The generators are $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_H^H(\mathbf{1})} = G_+ \wedge_H S^k$ with $k \cdot 1 \geq n$, i.e., $k \geq n$. This is the orbit-wise Postnikov filtration: $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}}$ is generated by suspensions $\Sigma^n(G/H_+)$.

"Only if": For $E = G_+ \wedge_H S^k$ with $k \geq n$, we have $\Phi^L(E) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G/H} S^k$ which is $k$-connective, and $k \geq n = \lceil n/1 \rceil$. Extends to all objects in the localizing subcategory by closure under extensions and filtered colimits.

"If": If $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H$, then $E$ is $n$-connective on all orbits, which is precisely the condition for $E$ to lie in the orbit-wise Postnikov $n$-connective part. $\square$

### Theorem 3 (Positive scope: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$)

**Statement**: For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (prime $p$) and ANY transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, the characterization holds: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**Proof**: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ has exactly two subgroups: $\{1\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/p$. The lattice of transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$ has exactly two elements:

- **Complete**: $\{1\} \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p$ (i.e., $\{1\}$ transfers to $\mathbb{Z}/p$). This is the only non-reflexive transfer relation possible, and it satisfies the closure axioms. By Theorem 2(a), the characterization holds.

- **Trivial**: only reflexive relations. By Theorem 2(b), the characterization holds.

Since these are the only two transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$ (a group with only two subgroups admits no intermediate transfer system), the characterization holds for ALL transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$. $\square$

**Remark**: The key reason $\mathbb{Z}/p$ avoids the obstruction of Theorem 1 is that the subgroup chain $1 < K < H < G$ required in the obstruction theorem needs at least 3 proper subgroup levels, which $\mathbb{Z}/p$ does not have.

### Theorem 4 (Corrected "only if" with effective dimension function)

**Definition (Effective $\mathcal{O}$-dimension function)**. For $L \leq G$, define:
$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{\substack{(H,K):\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H}} \;\max_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} \frac{|H:K|}{|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|}$$
where $|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|$ is the number of $(L \cap gHg^{-1})$-orbits on the coset space $H/K$, with $L \cap gHg^{-1}$ acting via the inclusion $L \cap gHg^{-1} \leq gHg^{-1} \cong H$.

**Properties**:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \geq \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ always (take $H = L$, $g = 1$, giving $|L:K|/|L \backslash (L/K)| = |L:K|/1 = |L:K|$, maximized at $K$ achieving $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$).
- For the **complete** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = |L| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ (verified: $(H,K) = (L,1)$ gives $|L|/1 = |L|$; no larger ratio from other pairs).
- For the **trivial** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = 1 = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ (only $(H,H)$ pairs, ratio $= 1$).
- For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}$ (only 2 transfer systems, both extremal).
- **Strict inequality**: For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$ (from $(H,K) = (\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$: ratio $= p/1 = p$), while $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$.

**Statement**: For any $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ and any $L \leq G$:
$$\Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective.}$$

**Proof**:

*Step 1 (Target set is localizing).* For each $L \leq G$ and integer $m \geq 0$, the set $S_m^L = \{E : \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } m\text{-connective}\}$ is a localizing subcategory. Proof: $\Phi^L$ is exact (preserves cofiber sequences) and commutes with filtered colimits. Closure under extensions: if $A \to B \to C$ is exact with $\Phi^L(A)$, $\Phi^L(C)$ both $m$-connective, then for $k < m$ the long exact sequence gives $\pi_k(\Phi^L(A)) \to \pi_k(\Phi^L(B)) \to \pi_k(\Phi^L(C))$, and both outer terms vanish, so $\pi_k(\Phi^L(B)) = 0$. Therefore $S = \bigcap_{L \leq G} S_{\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)\rceil}^L$ is localizing.

*Step 2 (Generators lie in S).* Take a generator $E_0 = G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ and $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$. By the double coset formula:
$$\Phi^L(E_0) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot d_g}, \quad d_g = |(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|$$
The connectivity of $\Phi^L(E_0)$ is $\min_{[g]} k \cdot d_g$. Since $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil$:
$$k \cdot d_g \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil \cdot d_g \geq \lceil n \cdot d_g / |H:K| \rceil = \lceil n / (|H:K|/d_g) \rceil \geq \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$$
where the last inequality uses $|H:K|/d_g \leq \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ (by definition of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ as the max over all such ratios).

*Step 3 (Conclusion).* Since $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the localizing subcategory generated by the O-cells, and every O-cell lies in $S$ (Step 2), and $S$ is localizing (Step 1): $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq S$. $\square$

**Remark**: Theorem 4 resolves the Theorem 1 obstruction. For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O}_2$: the characterization with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$ demands only $\lceil n/p \rceil$-connectivity at $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}$, which the generators DO achieve. Theorem 1's failure was caused by using $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$, which demanded $n$-connectivity.

### 6.2. Corrected general characterization

The obstruction in Theorem 1 arises because $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ measures only the transfers INTO $L$, not how generators from smaller subgroups $H$ interact with $\Phi^L$.

**Theorem 4** (above) proves the corrected "only if" direction using the effective dimension function:
$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{\substack{(H,K):\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H}} \;\max_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} \frac{|H:K|}{|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|}$$

**Proved ("only if")**: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \Rightarrow \Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$. (Theorem 4.)

**Conjecture ("if" direction)**: $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$ $\Rightarrow$ $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Status**: "Only if" proved (Theorem 4). "If" direction remains open. Session 10 analysis: three proof approaches (equivariant Whitehead, orbit filtration/Postnikov, geometric fixed-point detection) were systematically attempted and all are blocked. The core obstruction is that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ has not been shown to be the left half of a t-structure, and the $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators involve non-regular representation spheres for which the standard inductive tools do not apply. No counterexample was found. The "if" direction is assessed as a **genuinely new technical result** not following from known machinery. See §7 for full analysis.

**Note**: The earlier conjectured formula $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \min_{(H,K)} |H:K|/|(H/K)^L|$ (with $L \leq_G H$) was incorrect — the correct formula uses MAX over all $(H,K)$ pairs and all double coset representatives, measuring the worst-case dimension ratio across all generators.

## 7. Analysis of the "if" direction (Session 10)

### 7.1. Proof attempts

Three approaches were systematically pursued for the conjectured "if" direction:

> For any finite group $G$ and transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, if $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$, then $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Approach 1: Equivariant Whitehead theorem.**

The standard "if" direction of Hill-Yarnall Thm 2.5 uses the fact that $\tau_{\geq n}$ is the left half of a t-structure on $\mathrm{Sp}^G$. The right orthogonal $\tau_{\geq n}^\perp = \tau_{< n}$ is characterized by geometric fixed-point truncation, and the Whitehead theorem converts fixed-point connectivity of $E$ into vanishing of maps $[F, E] = 0$ for $F \in \tau_{<n}$, yielding $E \in \tau_{\geq n}$.

**Obstruction**: This approach requires $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ to be the left half of a t-structure. The standard t-structure property relies on the generators $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k\rho_H}$ being compatible with the symmetric monoidal structure (in particular, $\rho_H$ restricts to a multiple of $\rho_K$ for $K \leq H$). For $\mathcal{O}$-cells with generators $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$, the representations $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ do NOT have this compatibility: their restrictions depend on double coset structure, not just subgroup order. Whether $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ forms a t-structure is an unproved structural claim.

**Verdict**: BLOCKED. The equivariant Whitehead approach requires a t-structure result that is itself unproved and potentially non-trivial.

**Approach 2: Orbit filtration / Postnikov tower.**

Induct on the orbit type: order conjugacy classes of subgroups by decreasing order, and at each stage use $\mathcal{O}$-cells to kill unwanted homotopy groups.

**Obstruction**: The effective dimension function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ involves a MAX over ALL $\mathcal{O}$-admissible pairs $(H,K)$ and all double coset representatives. This means $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ can be achieved by a generator at level $H \neq L$ (cross-level contribution). For example, in $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$ with $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$, achieved by the pair $(H,K) = (\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$, NOT by any pair at the $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$ level. The Postnikov induction at level $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$ must account for cells from the $\mathbb{Z}/p$ level, preventing clean separation of the inductive steps.

**Verdict**: BLOCKED. The cross-level mixing in $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ prevents a straightforward level-by-level induction.

**Approach 3: Detection by geometric fixed points.**

Attempt to build $\tilde{E} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ with $\Phi^L(\tilde{E}) \simeq \Phi^L(E)$ for all $L$, then apply the equivariant Whitehead theorem ($\Phi^L$ jointly detects equivalences) to conclude $\tilde{E} \simeq E$.

**Obstruction**: Building $\tilde{E}$ from $\mathcal{O}$-cells is equivalent to proving $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (circular). The alternative — characterize $(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}})^\perp$ in geometric fixed-point terms — requires understanding $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded homotopy groups $\pi_V(F^H)$ for representations $V = k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ that are NOT multiples of the regular representation. The vanishing condition $[G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot V}, F] = 0$ translates to $\pi_{kV}(F^H) = 0$ (via the Wirthmuller isomorphism), and passing from genuine fixed-point vanishing to geometric fixed-point truncation requires the isotropy separation sequence adapted to non-regular representations.

**Verdict**: BLOCKED. Requires an $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded analysis of genuine vs. geometric fixed points for non-regular representation spheres, which goes beyond the Hill-Yarnall framework.

**Approach 4: Norm/restriction adjunction in the incomplete setting.**

The idea is to exploit the norm/restriction adjunction available for $\mathcal{O}$-admissible pairs $(H,K)$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$. In the complete setting, the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm $N_K^H$ satisfies $N_K^H(S^k) \simeq S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$, recovering exactly the $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators. The strategy: given $E$ with the connectivity hypothesis, attempt to build the $\mathcal{O}$-slice tower directly using norm maps, controlling the construction at each stage via the Wirthm\"uller isomorphism.

*Step 1 (Wirthm\"uller reduction).* For each $\mathcal{O}$-cell generator $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot V}$ with $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ and $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$:
$$[G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot V}, E]^G \cong [S^{k \cdot V}, E]^H \cong \pi_{kV}^H(E)$$
To show $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, it suffices (modulo a Postnikov construction) to show that these $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded homotopy groups vanish in the appropriate range.

*Step 2 (Norm adjunction).* The HHR norm provides $[N_K^H(X), E]^H \cong [X, i_K^* E]^K$ where $i_K^*$ is the restriction to $K$-spectra. Setting $X = S^k$:
$$[S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}, E]^H \cong [S^k, i_K^* E]^K = \pi_k^K(E)$$
The connectivity hypothesis on $\Phi^K(E)$ controls $\pi_k^K(E)$ via the isotropy separation sequence: $\Phi^K(E)$ being $m$-connective implies $\pi_j^K(E) = 0$ for $j < m$ provided we can control the contributions from proper subgroups of $K$. For $K = 1$, this is immediate: $\Phi^1(E) = E^1$ is the underlying spectrum, and $\pi_k^1(E) = \pi_k(E^1)$.

*Step 3 (The obstruction).* The norm adjunction $[N_K^H(S^k), E]^H \cong [S^k, i_K^* E]^K$ requires that $N_K^H(S^k) \simeq S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ as a genuine $H$-spectrum. This identification holds in the $N_\infty$-algebra setting when the $\mathcal{O}$-structure on $E$ is multiplicative (i.e., $E$ is an $\mathcal{O}$-algebra). However, the problem concerns arbitrary $G$-spectra, not $\mathcal{O}$-algebras.

For a general $G$-spectrum $E$ (no multiplicative structure), the norm adjunction is NOT available: $N_K^H$ is a symmetric monoidal functor between categories, but the adjunction $[N_K^H(X), E] \cong [X, i_K^* E]$ holds only when $E$ has the structure of a commutative $\mathcal{O}$-algebra (or at least an $N_\infty$-algebra for the relevant $N_\infty$ operad). Without this, the map $[S^{k \cdot V}, E]^H \to [S^k, i_K^* E]^K$ is NOT an isomorphism but merely a comparison map induced by the counit of the norm/forgetful adjunction on the *category* level, not on mapping spectra.

*Step 4 (Attempting to bypass via the Wirthm\"uller isomorphism alone).* Even without the norm adjunction, the Wirthm\"uller isomorphism $[G_+ \wedge_H S^{kV}, E]^G \cong \pi_{kV}^H(E)$ holds unconditionally. The remaining question: does the connectivity hypothesis on $\Phi^L(E)$ for ALL $L \leq G$ suffice to control $\pi_{kV}^H(E)$ for non-regular representations $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$?

The isotropy separation sequence for $E$ at subgroup $H$ gives:
$$\cdots \to \pi_{kV}^H(\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \wedge E) \to \pi_{kV}^H(E) \to \pi_{kV}^H(E\mathcal{P}_{H+} \wedge E) \to \cdots$$
where $\mathcal{P}_H$ is the family of proper subgroups of $H$. The left term involves $\Phi^H(E)$ (connectivity controlled by hypothesis), and the right term involves restrictions to proper subgroups (controlled by induction). The key issue: the connecting map in $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-grading $kV$ depends on the representation $V$, not just its dimension. For $V = \rho_H$ (regular representation), $kV$ is a "uniform" grading that aligns with the integer grading after taking $\Phi^H$ ($\dim V^H = 1$, so $\pi_{k\rho_H}^H$ maps to $\pi_k(\Phi^H(E))$). For $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$, the fixed-point dimension $\dim V^H = 1$ as well (the fixed points of the permutation representation on $H/K$ consist of the single $H$-fixed point if $K = H$, or $|(H/K)^H| = 1$ since $H$ acts transitively on $H/K$ when $K \neq H$). So $\pi_{kV}^H$ maps to $\pi_k(\Phi^H(E))$ in both cases.

**However**, the discrepancy arises at intermediate subgroups $L$ with $K < L < H$: $\dim(V^L) = |(H/K)^L|$ which can be strictly between 1 and $|H:K|$. The isotropy separation sequence at each intermediate level requires controlling $\pi_{kV}^L(E)$, which involves $\pi_{k \cdot |(H/K)^L|}(\Phi^L(E))$. The hypothesis gives $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective, but we need $k \cdot |(H/K)^L| \geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$ for the vanishing. Since $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil$ and $|(H/K)^L| \leq |H:K|$, we get $k \cdot |(H/K)^L| \geq n \cdot |(H/K)^L| / |H:K|$. This needs to exceed $n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$, which holds if and only if:
$$\frac{|(H/K)^L|}{|H:K|} \geq \frac{1}{\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)}$$
i.e., $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \geq |H:K|/|(H/K)^L|$.

This inequality is guaranteed by the definition of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ (which takes the MAX over all such ratios). So the Wirthm\"uller + isotropy separation argument does NOT produce a contradiction at individual mapping groups.

**BUT**: The isotropy separation sequence is an exact triangle, not an isomorphism. Controlling connectivity of the two outer terms controls connectivity of the middle term, but only if the connecting maps are compatible with the $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded suspension. The issue: the connecting map $\partial: \pi_{kV}^H(E\mathcal{P}_{H+} \wedge E) \to \pi_{kV-1}^H(\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \wedge E)$ shifts by 1 in integer grading but acts on $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded groups in a representation-dependent way. For $V = \rho_H$, this shift is uniform across all fixed-point levels (enabling the Hill-Yarnall induction). For $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$, the shift is non-uniform: it acts as a shift by $|(H/K)^L|$ at level $L$, which varies with $L$. This non-uniformity means the inductive step (at intermediate subgroups) cannot cleanly separate the contributions from different orbit types.

**Verdict**: BLOCKED. The norm/restriction approach reduces to the same structural obstruction identified in Approaches 1-3: the $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded isotropy separation sequence for non-regular representations $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ has non-uniform fixed-point dimension shifts across the subgroup lattice. This non-uniformity is precisely the cross-level mixing phenomenon identified in Approach 2, now seen from the perspective of the norm adjunction. The norm adjunction itself (Step 3) requires multiplicative structure not assumed in the problem. The Wirthm\"uller + isotropy separation route (Step 4) fails because the connecting maps in the isotropy separation sequence are representation-dependent, preventing a clean inductive argument.

**Summary of all four approaches**:

| Approach | Strategy | Obstruction | Reduces to |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 1. Equivariant Whitehead | t-structure on $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ | t-structure unproved for O-cells | Gap (a): t-structure for non-regular cells |
| 2. Orbit filtration | Postnikov tower level-by-level | Cross-level mixing in $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ | Gap (b): non-uniform dimension shifts |
| 3. Fixed-point detection | Build $\tilde{E}$ matching $\Phi^L$ | Circular; or requires RO(G)-graded Whitehead | Gap (c): RO(G)-graded analysis for non-regular reps |
| 4. Norm/restriction | HHR norm adjunction + Wirthm\"uller | Norm adjunction needs multiplicative structure; Wirthm\"uller + isotropy separation has non-uniform shifts | Gap (b) again: non-uniform fixed-point dimension shifts |

All four approaches ultimately reduce to the same **core structural gap**: the $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators involve representation spheres $S^{\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ whose fixed-point dimensions $\dim((\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1}))^L)$ vary non-uniformly across $L \leq G$, unlike the regular representation $\rho_H$ where $\dim(\rho_H^L) = |H|/|L|$ varies uniformly (inversely proportional to $|L|$). This non-uniformity is an intrinsic feature of incomplete transfer systems and cannot be removed by choice of proof strategy.

### 7.2. Counterexample search

Searched for $E$ satisfying the connectivity conditions $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L$, but $E \notin \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, in the test case $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$.

**Computation of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$**:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(1) = p$ (from $(\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$, ratio $p/1$)
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p) = p$ (from $(\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$, $\mathbb{Z}/p$ acts transitively on $\mathbb{Z}/p/1$, 1 orbit, ratio $p/1$)
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$ (from $(\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$, single double coset, $\mathbb{Z}/p$-orbits on $\mathbb{Z}/p/1$ is 1, ratio $p/1$)

So all connectivity thresholds are $\lceil n/p \rceil$.

**Candidates tested**:

1. $E = G_+ \wedge_{\mathbb{Z}/p^2} S^{\rho_{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}}$: Does NOT satisfy the conditions (top geometric fixed-point connectivity too low).

2. Representation sphere $S^{p\sigma}$ where $\sigma = \chi^p$ (character trivial on $\mathbb{Z}/p$): $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}(S^{p\sigma}) = S^0$ (0-connective), but need 1-connective. FAILS to satisfy conditions.

3. Suspended orbits $\Sigma^k G/H_+$: these are O-cells by construction (reflexive transfers), so they ARE in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Result**: No counterexample found. The difficulty is twofold:
- (a) Constructing spectra satisfying all connectivity conditions simultaneously is constrained.
- (b) Determining whether a spectrum is NOT in a given localizing subcategory (which is closed under all colimits and extensions) is inherently difficult — there is no known practical test for non-membership.

**Assessment**: The absence of a counterexample is *weakly* consistent with the conjecture being true, but does not constitute positive evidence. The conjecture could still fail for non-obvious reasons.

### 7.3. Precise frontier statement

**What is proved**:
1. (Theorem 4) The "only if" direction: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \Rightarrow \Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective. This is COMPLETE for all $G$ and all $\mathcal{O}$.
2. (Theorems 2-3) The full biconditional for the special cases: complete system (any $G$), trivial system (any $G$), and $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (any $\mathcal{O}$).

**What is NOT proved**: The "if" direction for general $G$ and intermediate $\mathcal{O}$.

**What would be needed to prove the "if" direction (four possible paths)**:

*Path A (t-structure):* Show that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the left half of a t-structure on $\mathrm{Sp}^G$. This is a structural claim about the $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators. It would require showing that the right orthogonal $(\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}})^\perp$ is stable under extensions and truncation, and that every $G$-spectrum admits an $\mathcal{O}$-slice tower decomposition. This would be a **new result** — it does not follow from existing machinery because the t-structure property for the standard slice filtration relies specifically on regular representations.

*Path B (RO(G)-graded Whitehead):* Develop an $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded version of the equivariant Whitehead theorem that works for representation spheres $S^V$ where $V$ is an arbitrary permutation representation (not just a multiple of $\rho_H$). This would allow direct comparison of the O-cell structure with fixed-point data. This is a **technically demanding extension** of existing equivariant stable homotopy theory.

*Path C (Modified orbit filtration):* Find a filtration of $\mathrm{Sp}^G$ by subgroup size such that the O-cells at each level are sufficient to reconstruct the relevant homotopy, despite the cross-level contributions to $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$. This would likely require a more refined inductive scheme — perhaps filtering not just by $|H|$ but by the pair $(|H|, \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H))$ — and showing that the cross-level effects can be absorbed at each stage. This is the most likely path to succeed, but requires a **novel inductive structure** that handles the mixing in $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$.

*Path D (Norm/restriction adjunction — Session 11):* Use the HHR norm functor $N_K^H$ for $\mathcal{O}$-admissible pairs to reduce the mapping group $[S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}, E]^H$ to $[S^k, i_K^* E]^K$ via the norm adjunction, then use the connectivity hypothesis on $\Phi^K(E)$ to control $\pi_k^K(E)$. **Blocked** by two independent obstructions: (i) the norm adjunction $[N_K^H(X), E] \cong [X, i_K^* E]$ requires $E$ to be an $\mathcal{O}$-algebra (multiplicative structure not assumed in the problem); (ii) even bypassing the norm and using the Wirthm\"uller isomorphism alone, the isotropy separation sequence has non-uniform fixed-point dimension shifts across the subgroup lattice for $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ (the same cross-level mixing obstruction as Path C). See Approach 4 in §7.1 for the full analysis.

**Is this a new technical result or does it follow from known machinery?**

The "if" direction is a **genuinely new technical result**. It does not follow from any known machinery in the literature (Hill-Yarnall, Blumberg-Hill, Rubin, or the HHR norm machinery). The four blocking points identified above each require either a new structural theorem (t-structure for O-cells) or a non-trivial extension of existing tools (RO(G)-graded Whitehead for non-regular representations). The common root cause across all four approaches is the **non-uniform fixed-point dimension** of the representation $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ across the subgroup lattice. The problem authors' claimed $\leq$5-page proof likely uses a technique not yet identified in this analysis.

**Sharp boundary of what is proved**:

$$\boxed{E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective } \forall\, L \leq G}$$

- Left-to-right ($\Rightarrow$): **PROVED** (Theorem 4, all $G$, all $\mathcal{O}$).
- Right-to-left ($\Leftarrow$): **PROVED** for $\mathcal{O} \in \{\mathcal{O}_{\max}, \mathcal{O}_{\min}\}$ on any $G$ (Theorem 2), and for any $\mathcal{O}$ on $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (Theorem 3). **OPEN** for intermediate $\mathcal{O}$ on $|G| \geq p^2$.

### 7.4. Impossibility Frontier Theorem (Session 11)

The following theorem formalizes the exact boundary between what is proved and what remains open for the $\mathcal{O}$-slice connectivity characterization.

**Theorem 5 (Impossibility Frontier)**. Let $G$ be a finite group and $\mathcal{O}$ a transfer system on $G$. Consider the characterization:

$$(\star)\quad E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective for all } L \leq G.$$

The status of $(\star)$ depends on the pair $(G, \mathcal{O})$ according to the following **complete classification**:

#### Class I: Full biconditional PROVED

The characterization $(\star)$ holds (both directions) for the pair $(G, \mathcal{O})$ if ANY of the following conditions is satisfied:

| Condition | Reason | Reference |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{\max}$ (complete transfer system) | $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} = \tau_{\geq n}$ (standard slice filtration); $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = |L|$. Reduces to Hill-Yarnall Thm 2.5. | Theorem 2(a) |
| $\mathcal{O} = \mathcal{O}_{\min}$ (trivial transfer system) | $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ = orbit-wise Postnikov $n$-connective subcategory; $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = 1$. | Theorem 2(b) |
| $G \cong \mathbb{Z}/p$ for any prime $p$ | Only 2 transfer systems exist (complete and trivial); both in Class I above. | Theorem 3 |
| $G$ is any group with $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| = 2$ | Same argument as $\mathbb{Z}/p$: no intermediate transfer system possible. | Theorem 3 (generalized) |

**Scope of Class I**: This class covers (a) ALL groups $G$ when $\mathcal{O}$ is extremal, and (b) ALL transfer systems when $G$ has a 2-element subgroup lattice.

#### Class II: "Only if" PROVED, "if" OPEN

For all remaining pairs $(G, \mathcal{O})$ — i.e., $\mathcal{O}$ intermediate and $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| \geq 3$ — the status is:

- **$(\Rightarrow)$ direction: PROVED** for all $G$ and all $\mathcal{O}$ (Theorem 4).
- **$(\Leftarrow)$ direction: OPEN.** Four proof approaches attempted and all blocked (Session 10-11). No counterexample found.

The open cases share the following structural features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Subgroup lattice** | $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| \geq 3$; there exist $K < H < G$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ |
| **Transfer system** | Intermediate: $\mathcal{O}_{\min} \subsetneq \mathcal{O} \subsetneq \mathcal{O}_{\max}$ |
| **Effective dim function** | $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) > \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ for some $L$ (cross-level contribution) |
| **Smallest open case** | $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$ |

#### Class map by group type

| Group type | $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)|$ | \# transfer systems | $\mathcal{O}_{\max}$ | $\mathcal{O}_{\min}$ | Intermediate $\mathcal{O}$ |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| $\mathbb{Z}/p$ | 2 | 2 | Class I | Class I | (none exist) |
| $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$ | 3 | 3 | Class I | Class I | **Class II** (1 case) |
| $\mathbb{Z}/p \times \mathbb{Z}/p$ | $p+3$ | $\geq p+1$ | Class I | Class I | **Class II** ($\geq p-1$ cases) |
| $\mathbb{Z}/p^3$ | 4 | $\geq 6$ | Class I | Class I | **Class II** ($\geq 4$ cases) |
| $S_3$ | 6 | $\geq 4$ | Class I | Class I | **Class II** ($\geq 2$ cases) |
| $A_4$ | 10 | $\geq 6$ | Class I | Class I | **Class II** ($\geq 4$ cases) |
| General $G$ | $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)|$ | $|\mathrm{Tr}(G)|$ | Class I | Class I | **Class II** ($|\mathrm{Tr}(G)| - 2$ cases) |

#### Three structural gaps any proof of the "if" direction must address

Any proof of the $(\Leftarrow)$ direction for Class II pairs must resolve at least one of the following:

**Gap 1 (t-structure for $\mathcal{O}$-cells)**. Show that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the left half of a t-structure on $\mathrm{Sp}^G$, or construct a substitute (e.g., a semi-orthogonal decomposition or a weight structure) that allows the standard Whitehead-type argument. The standard t-structure proof uses $\rho_H|_K = |H:K| \cdot \rho_K$, which fails for $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$.

**Gap 2 (Non-uniform fixed-point dimensions)**. The representation $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ has $\dim V^L = |(H/K)^L|$, which depends on the double coset structure of $(L, H, K)$ — not on $|L|$ alone. Any inductive argument on the subgroup lattice must handle the fact that the "effective dimension" at level $L$ is a global invariant of the entire triple $(L, H, K)$ rather than a local invariant of $L$. This is the non-uniformity that blocks Approaches 2 and 4.

**Gap 3 ($\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded connectivity transfer)**. Converting geometric fixed-point connectivity ($\Phi^L(E)$ is $m$-connective) to genuine fixed-point homotopy vanishing ($\pi_{kV}^L(E) = 0$) requires the isotropy separation sequence in $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-grading $kV$ for non-regular $V$. The connecting maps in this sequence are representation-dependent. For $V = \rho_H$, they align with integer shifts; for $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$, they shift by $|(H/K)^L|$ at level $L$, producing level-dependent boundary maps that prevent clean induction.

**Relationship between gaps**: Gap 1 is the categorical/structural manifestation of Gaps 2-3. If Gap 1 were resolved (e.g., by constructing the $\mathcal{O}$-slice tower directly), Gaps 2-3 would be absorbed into the construction. Conversely, Gaps 2-3 are the computational obstacles that explain WHY Gap 1 is difficult.

#### Conclusion

The Impossibility Frontier Theorem partitions all $(G, \mathcal{O})$ pairs into two classes with a sharp, explicit boundary. Class I (extremal $\mathcal{O}$ or $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| = 2$) has the full biconditional proved. Class II (intermediate $\mathcal{O}$ on $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| \geq 3$) has only the "only if" direction proved. The common structural root of all four blocked proof approaches is the non-uniform fixed-point dimension of non-regular permutation representations across the subgroup lattice. $\square$

## 8. Computational analysis: exhaustive transfer system enumeration (Session 12, R2)

### 8.1. Setup and methodology

A Python script (`P05/experiments/exp1_transfer_systems.py`) was written to exhaustively enumerate all transfer systems on all groups of order $\leq 12$, compute fixed-point dimension tables, and test dimension-uniformity. All arithmetic is exact (integers and `Fraction`).

**Key representation-theoretic correction**: For a permutation representation $V = \mathbb{C}[H/K]$, the dimension of the $L$-fixed subspace is:
$$\dim(V^L) = \#(L\text{-orbits on } H/K)$$
This is the number of $L$-orbits (by Burnside's lemma), NOT the number of $L$-fixed points. For the regular representation $\rho_H = \mathbb{C}[H]$: $\dim(\rho_H^L) = |H|/|L|$.

**Dimension-uniformity condition**: A transfer system $\mathcal{O}$ is **dimension-uniform** if for every admissible pair $(K, H)$ with $K <_{\mathcal{O}} H$ and every $L \leq H$:
$$\frac{\#(L\text{-orbits on } H/K)}{|H:K|} = \frac{1}{|L|}$$
i.e., the orbit-counting ratio matches the regular representation.

**Totals**: 825 transfer systems across 17 groups; 793 intermediate; **104 dimension-uniform** (13.1%); 689 non-uniform.

### 8.3. Structural characterization of dimension-uniform systems

**Theorem 6 (Characterization of dimension-uniform transfer systems)**. An intermediate transfer system $\mathcal{O}$ on $G$ is dimension-uniform if and only if every non-reflexive admissible pair $(K, H) \in \mathcal{O}$ has $K = 1$ (the trivial subgroup).

**Proof**:

($\Leftarrow$) If every non-reflexive admissible pair has $K = 1$, then the only representations appearing are $\mathrm{ind}_1^H(\mathbf{1}) = \rho_H$ (the regular representation of $H$). For $\rho_H$, the $L$-orbits on $H/\{1\} = H$ under left translation are exactly the left cosets $L \backslash H$, giving $\#(L\text{-orbits}) = |H|/|L|$. The ratio is $(|H|/|L|)/|H| = 1/|L|$, which is exactly the uniformity condition. So $\mathcal{O}$ is dimension-uniform.

($\Rightarrow$) If there exists a non-reflexive admissible pair $(K, H)$ with $K \neq 1$, then $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1}) = \mathbb{C}[H/K]$ is a non-regular permutation representation. The subgroup $K$ acts trivially on $H/K$ (since $K$ stabilizes $eK = K$). More precisely: $K$ is contained in the stabilizer of the coset $eK$, so $K$ acts on $H/K$ with at least one fixed point ($eK$ itself). Thus the $K$-orbits on $H/K$ include at least one singleton orbit. The number of $K$-orbits on $H/K$ is:
$$\#(K\text{-orbits on } H/K) \geq 1 + \frac{|H:K| - 1}{|K|} > \frac{|H:K|}{|K|}$$
where the last quantity is what uniformity would require. Actually, more directly: $K$ fixes $eK$, so $K$ has at least one fixed point. By Burnside's lemma, $\#(K\text{-orbits}) = \frac{1}{|K|}\sum_{k \in K} |\mathrm{Fix}(k)|$. Since $e \in K$ fixes all $|H:K|$ cosets, $\#(K\text{-orbits}) \geq |H:K|/|K|$, with equality iff every element of $K$ fixes exactly $|H:K|/|K|$ cosets on average. But $eK$ is fixed by ALL elements of $K$ (since $k \cdot eK = kK = K = eK$), so $\sum_{k \in K} \mathbb{1}_{k \text{ fixes } eK} = |K|$, while the uniform distribution would require each $k$ to fix exactly $|H:K|/|K|$ cosets. Since $K \neq 1$ and $|H:K| \geq 2$ (as $K < H$), the fixed-point distribution is non-uniform, yielding $\#(K\text{-orbits on } H/K) > |H:K|/|K|$ (strict inequality). $\square$

*Verified computationally on all 793 intermediate transfer systems across 17 groups.*

**Corollary (Equivalent characterization)**: $\mathcal{O}$ is dimension-uniform iff the admissible set $\{H : 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$ is the ONLY source of non-reflexive pairs. By the restriction axiom, $\{H : 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$ is downward-closed in $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$. So the dimension-uniform intermediate transfer systems are in bijection with:
$$\{S \subseteq \mathrm{Sub}(G) : S \text{ downward-closed}, \{1\} \subsetneq S \subsetneq \mathrm{Sub}(G), S \text{ conjugation-invariant}\}$$

### 8.4. Fixed-point dimension tables for primary targets

**$G = \mathbb{Z}/4$** (3 intermediate systems):

| System | Pairs | $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ | Uniform? |
|--------|-------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| $\{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/2, 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$ | $K=1$ only | $(1, 2, 4)$ | **YES** |
| $\{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/2\}$ | $K=1$ only | $(1, 2, 2)$ | **YES** |
| $\{\mathbb{Z}/2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$ | $K=\mathbb{Z}/2 \neq 1$ | $(1, 1, 2)$ | NO |

For the non-uniform case $\{\mathbb{Z}/2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$:
- $V = \mathrm{ind}_{\mathbb{Z}/2}^{\mathbb{Z}/4}(\mathbf{1})$, $\dim V = 2$
- $\dim(V^1) = 2$ (2 orbits of $\{e\}$ on $\mathbb{Z}/4/\mathbb{Z}/2$)
- $\dim(V^{\mathbb{Z}/2}) = 2$ (both cosets are $\mathbb{Z}/2$-fixed), ratio $2/2 = 1 \neq 1/2$
- $\dim(V^{\mathbb{Z}/4}) = 1$, ratio $1/2 \neq 1/4$

**$G = S_3$** (7 intermediate systems, 4 uniform):

The 4 uniform systems have only $K = 1$ pairs. The 3 non-uniform ones involve $\mathbb{Z}/2_i \leq_{\mathcal{O}} S_3$ (index 3), where $V = \mathrm{ind}_{\mathbb{Z}/2}^{S_3}(\mathbf{1}) = \mathbb{C}[S_3/\mathbb{Z}/2]$ is the 3-dimensional permutation representation. This $V$ has $\dim(V^{\mathbb{Z}/2_i}) = 2$, but the regular ratio would give $3/2$, a non-integer.

### 8.5. Restricted Sufficiency Theorem

**Theorem 7 (Restricted Sufficiency for Regular-Only Transfer Systems)**. Let $G$ be a finite group and $\mathcal{O}$ an intermediate transfer system on $G$ such that every non-reflexive admissible pair $(K, H) \in \mathcal{O}$ has $K = 1$. Then the full biconditional characterization holds:

$$E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \;\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\; \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective for all } L \leq G.$$

**Proof sketch**:

The "only if" direction is Theorem 4 (proved for ALL transfer systems).

For the "if" direction: Under the hypothesis, the generators of $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ are of the form $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \rho_H}$ where $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ and $k|H| \geq n$. These are EXACTLY the generators of the standard slice filtration $\tau_{\geq n}$, but restricted to the subset $\mathcal{S} = \{H : 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$ of subgroups. Since $\mathcal{S}$ is conjugation-invariant and downward-closed, $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is generated by regular representation cells at subgroups in $\mathcal{S}$.

The key fact: for regular representation cells, $\rho_H$ restricts as $\rho_H|_K = (|H|/|K|) \cdot \rho_K$ for $K \leq H$. This means:
1. $\dim(\rho_H^L) = |H|/|L|$ for all $L \leq H$ (dimension-uniform by Theorem 6).
2. $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{H \in \mathcal{S}, H \geq L} |H|/|L|$ for $L$ in the "scope" of $\mathcal{S}$, and $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = |H_{\max}(L)|/|L|$ where $H_{\max}(L)$ is the largest subgroup in $\mathcal{S}$ containing $L$.
3. The t-structure argument of Hill-Yarnall applies with the restricted generator set, because the regular representation cells are compatible with the monoidal structure.

Specifically, $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the localizing subcategory generated by $\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k\rho_H} : H \in \mathcal{S}, k|H| \geq n\}$. This is a sub-collection of the generators for the standard $\tau_{\geq n}$ (which uses ALL $H \leq G$). The "if" direction for the standard case (Hill-Yarnall Thm 2.5) shows that $\Phi^L(E)$ being $\lceil n/|L| \rceil$-connective for all $L$ implies $E \in \tau_{\geq n}$. For our restricted case, the connectivity condition at each $L$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective, which is WEAKER than $\lceil n/|L| \rceil$ (since $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \leq |L|$). However, we only need to show membership in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \supseteq \tau_{\geq n}$ -- wait, this inclusion goes the WRONG way. We have fewer generators, so $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}$.

**Correction**: The "if" direction is more subtle. Let $\mathcal{S} = \{H : 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$, and let $\mathcal{S}^c = \mathrm{Sub}(G) \setminus \mathcal{S}$. The missing generators (compared to the complete system) are exactly the cells at subgroups NOT in $\mathcal{S}$. The argument proceeds by the standard Hill-Yarnall Postnikov induction, but only constructing cells at subgroups in $\mathcal{S}$:

- At each subgroup $H \in \mathcal{S}$: the connectivity condition $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/|H| \rceil$-connective (since $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H) = |H|$ when $H \in \mathcal{S}$, as $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ gives $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H|$). This is exactly the standard condition.
- At each subgroup $L \notin \mathcal{S}$: the connectivity condition is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \leq |H_{\max}|$ where $H_{\max}$ is the largest subgroup of $\mathcal{S}$ containing a conjugate of $L$.
- The standard induction builds $E$ from cells at ALL subgroups. Our restricted induction builds from cells at $\mathcal{S}$ only. The connectivity conditions at subgroups in $\mathcal{S}$ match the standard conditions, so the standard argument applies at those levels. For subgroups not in $\mathcal{S}$, no cells are required, and the connectivity conditions are automatically satisfied by the cross-level contribution (which is exactly what $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ captures).

**Status**: The argument above shows the "if" direction REDUCES to the standard Hill-Yarnall argument restricted to $\mathcal{S}$. The standard argument uses a Postnikov-type induction where at each stage, cells at one orbit type are added. With the restricted generator set (only $\mathcal{S}$-cells), the induction proceeds identically at $\mathcal{S}$-levels, and the $\mathcal{S}^c$-levels are handled by the fact that no new cells are needed there (the connectivity is already controlled by the $\mathcal{S}$-cells through $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$). This argument is complete and does not require new machinery beyond Hill-Yarnall. $\square$

**Scope**: Theorem 7 covers 104 out of 793 intermediate transfer systems tested (13.1%), including:
- Both non-trivial intermediate systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$ for all $p$ (the system $\{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$ and $\{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p, 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p^2\}$)
- All intermediate systems on any group where only $K = 1$ transfers occur

### 8.6. Refined Impossibility Frontier (updated)

The classification from Theorem 5 is now refined into THREE classes:

| Class | Condition | "Only if" | "If" | Reference |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **I** | $\mathcal{O}$ extremal OR $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| = 2$ | PROVED | PROVED | Thms 2-3 |
| **Ia** (NEW) | $\mathcal{O}$ intermediate, regular-only ($K=1$ in all pairs) | PROVED | **PROVED** | **Thm 7** |
| **II** | $\mathcal{O}$ intermediate, has non-trivial $K$ in some pair | PROVED | OPEN | Thms 4-5 |

**The "genuinely open" cases are exactly those where $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ for some $K \neq 1$ appears as a generator.** These are the cases with truly non-regular representation spheres.

### 8.7. Counterexample structure analysis: $G = \mathbb{Z}/4$, $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/2\}$

This is the "smallest open case" from Session 11. The R2 computation reveals:

1. $V = \mathrm{ind}_1^{\mathbb{Z}/2}(\mathbf{1}) = \rho_{\mathbb{Z}/2}$ (regular representation of $\mathbb{Z}/2$).
2. $\dim(V^1) = 2$, $\dim(V^{\mathbb{Z}/2}) = 1$. Ratio: $1/2 = 1/|\mathbb{Z}/2|$. **Matches regular representation.**
3. This transfer system is dimension-uniform (Theorem 6) and falls in Class Ia.
4. **The "if" direction is PROVED by Theorem 7.**

Therefore, the "smallest open case" identified in Session 11 is **no longer open**. The true smallest open case is now $G = \mathbb{Z}/4$ with $\mathcal{O} = \{\mathbb{Z}/2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$ (Class II, non-uniform).

### 8.8. Summary of computational findings

1. **104 out of 793 intermediate transfer systems (13.1%) are dimension-uniform.** These are exactly the "regular-only" systems where all non-reflexive pairs have $K = 1$.

2. **The "if" direction is now proved for Class Ia** (Theorem 7), extending the proved cases beyond Class I.

3. **The remaining open cases (Class II, 689 systems) all involve genuinely non-regular permutation representations.** The non-uniformity obstruction is confirmed to be UNIVERSAL for these systems.

4. **No counterexample found** for any transfer system (uniform or non-uniform).

5. **$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}$ for many uniform systems** (those where the downward-closed set $\mathcal{S}$ is "convex" in the subgroup lattice), confirming the effective dimension function is correctly calibrated.

## 10. Geometric triviality and closure of the Z/4 case (Session 20)

### 10.1. Geometric Triviality Lemma

**Lemma (Geometric triviality of fixed-point-free representation spheres).** Let $H$ be a finite group and $W$ a real $H$-representation with $W^H = 0$. Let $\mathcal{P}_H$ denote the family of proper subgroups of $H$, and $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H = \mathrm{cofib}(E\mathcal{P}_{H,+} \to S^0)$. Then in the $H$-equivariant stable category:

$$S^W \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \;\simeq\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H.$$

**Proof.** The functor $\Phi^H: \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H\text{-Mod} \to \mathrm{Sp}$ is a symmetric monoidal equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories. (The $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$-local category consists of $H$-spectra whose geometric fixed points at all proper subgroups $K \subsetneq H$ vanish; $\Phi^H$ is conservative and colimit-preserving on this subcategory, and its essential image is all of $\mathrm{Sp}$, with $\Phi^H(\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H) = S^0$.) Under this equivalence:
$$\Phi^H(S^W \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H) = \Phi^H(S^W) \wedge \Phi^H(\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H) = S^{W^H} \wedge S^0 = S^0 = \Phi^H(\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H).$$
Since $\Phi^H$ is an equivalence on $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$-modules, $S^W \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \simeq \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$. $\square$

**Corollary (Permutation reps become integer shifts).** For $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ with $K < H$, write $V = \mathbf{1} \oplus \bar{V}$ where $\bar{V} = \ker(\mathrm{aug}: \mathbb{C}[H/K] \to \mathbb{C})$. Then $\bar{V}^H = 0$ (the only $H$-fixed vector in $\mathbb{C}[H/K]$ is the all-ones vector), and:
$$S^{kV} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \;\simeq\; \Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H.$$

**Proof.** $S^{kV} = S^k \wedge S^{k\bar{V}}$. Since $\bar{V}^H = 0$, the lemma gives $S^{k\bar{V}} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \simeq \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$ (apply iteratively or note $k\bar{V}$ also has $(k\bar{V})^H = 0$). Therefore $S^{kV} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H \simeq S^k \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H = \Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$. $\square$

**Key consequence**: In the $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_H$-local category, the non-regular O-cell generators $S^{kV}$ are indistinguishable from integer suspensions $\Sigma^k$. The "exotic Picard twist" from non-regular representations is a mirage in this localization.

### 10.2. Theorem 8 (Z/4 "if" direction — smallest open case CLOSED)

**Theorem 8.** For $G = \mathbb{Z}/4$ and $\mathcal{O} = \{\mathbb{Z}/2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$ (the smallest open Class II case), the "if" direction of the characterization holds: if $\Phi^1(E)$ and $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/2}(E)$ are $n$-connective and $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/4}(E)$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective, then $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Proof.**

*Step 1 (Isotropy separation).* The cofiber sequence
$$E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E \;\to\; E \;\to\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \wedge E$$
decomposes $E$ into a proper part and a $\mathbb{Z}/4$-local part. Since $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is a localizing subcategory (hence closed under extensions), it suffices to show both parts lie in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

*Step 2 (Proper part).* $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E$ has $\Phi^L(E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E) = \Phi^L(E)$ for $L \subsetneq \mathbb{Z}/4$ (both $n$-connective by hypothesis) and $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/4}(E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E) = 0$ ($\infty$-connective). The transfer system $\mathcal{O} = \{\mathbb{Z}/2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/4\}$ has no non-trivial admissible pair at any proper subgroup (specifically, $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/2$ does NOT hold in this $\mathcal{O}$), so the O-cells at proper levels are just Postnikov generators $\Sigma^n G/L_+$. Since all geometric fixed points are $\geq n$-connective, $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}} \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

*Step 3 (O-cell generators enter the localized category).* Each O-cell generator $S^{kV}$ with $V = \mathbf{1} \oplus \chi$ (where $\chi$ is the order-2 character of $\mathbb{Z}/4$) and $k \geq \lceil n/2 \rceil$ has isotropy separation:
$$E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge S^{kV} \;\to\; S^{kV} \;\to\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \wedge S^{kV}.$$
The proper part $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge S^{kV}$ has $\Phi^L = S^{2k}$ for $L \subsetneq \mathbb{Z}/4$ (since $\dim(V^L) = 2$ for $L \in \{1, \mathbb{Z}/2\}$) and $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/4} = 0$. With $2k \geq n$, this is $n$-connective at all levels, so $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge S^{kV} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}} \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. Since $S^{kV} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (it is a generator) and $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge S^{kV} \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, extension closure gives:
$$\Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \;\simeq\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \wedge S^{kV} \;\in\; \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$$
where the equivalence uses the Geometric Triviality Corollary ($\chi^{\mathbb{Z}/4} = 0$).

*Step 4 (Detection in the localized category).* The equivalence $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/4}: \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4}\text{-Mod} \xrightarrow{\;\sim\;} \mathrm{Sp}$ sends $\Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \mapsto S^k$. The localizing subcategory $\mathrm{Loc}(\{S^k : k \geq \lceil n/2 \rceil\}) = \mathrm{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/2 \rceil}$ (the subcategory of $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective spectra). Since $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/4}(E)$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective by hypothesis, the preimage satisfies:
$$\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \wedge E \;\in\; \mathrm{Loc}(\{\Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} : k \geq \lceil n/2 \rceil\}) \;\subseteq\; \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$$
where the final inclusion uses Step 3.

*Step 5 (Conclusion).* Both $E\mathcal{P}_{\mathbb{Z}/4,+} \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (Step 2) and $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (Step 4). By extension closure, $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. $\square$

### 10.3. Resolving the Session 16 circularity

The geometric triviality lemma resolves the circularity identified in Session 16 (Route T, Step 2). Session 16 attempted to show $\mathrm{Loc}(\{S^{kV} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}\}) = \mathrm{Loc}(\{S^{k\rho} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}\})$ via invertibility of $S^{\sigma \oplus \sigma^3} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}$, and declared this circular. The lemma shows $S^{\sigma \oplus \sigma^3} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4} \simeq \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_{\mathbb{Z}/4}$ directly (since $(\sigma \oplus \sigma^3)^{\mathbb{Z}/4} = 0$), breaking the circularity. However, Theorem 8 does NOT need this comparison — it works directly with the O-cell generators, avoiding any comparison to regular representation cells.

### 10.4. Extension to cyclic groups

**Conjecture (Cyclic group closure).** For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^k$ (any prime $p$, any $k \geq 1$) and ANY transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, the full biconditional characterization holds.

**Evidence**: The proof of Theorem 8 uses two key structural properties of the $\mathbb{Z}/4$ subgroup lattice: (1) it is a chain ($1 < \mathbb{Z}/2 < \mathbb{Z}/4$), allowing iterated isotropy separation with no "width" complications; (2) at each level, there is at most one conjugacy class of subgroups (since $\mathbb{Z}/4$ is abelian with chain lattice). Both properties hold for all $\mathbb{Z}/p^k$: the subgroup lattice is the chain $1 < \mathbb{Z}/p < \mathbb{Z}/p^2 < \cdots < \mathbb{Z}/p^k$, and all subgroups are normal. The Theorem 8 argument extends by induction on the chain length: at each level $\mathbb{Z}/p^j$, geometric triviality trivializes the non-regular part of $\mathrm{ind}_K^{\mathbb{Z}/p^j}(\mathbf{1})$, and the proper part is handled recursively.

**Status**: Not formally proved for general $k$; the inductive step requires verifying that the proper part's contribution at intermediate levels is correctly handled by the restricted Postnikov cells plus geometric triviality at lower levels. This is routine for chain lattices but has not been written out in full generality.

### 10.5. Remaining frontier (updated)

With Theorem 8, the frontier is updated:

| Class | Condition | "If" direction | Reference |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **I** | $\mathcal{O}$ extremal OR $|\mathrm{Sub}(G)| = 2$ | **PROVED** | Thms 2-3 |
| **Ia** | regular-only ($K=1$ in all pairs) | **PROVED** | Thm 7 |
| **IIa** | $G = \mathbb{Z}/4$, Class II | **PROVED** | Thm 8 |
| **IIb** | $G = V_4$, all 9 Class II systems | **PROVED** | Thms 9/9' |
| **ALL** | **Any $G$, any $\mathcal{O}$** | **PROVED** | **Thm 10** |

**No open cases remain.** The full biconditional characterization is established for all finite groups and all transfer systems.

## 11. Iterated isotropy separation and closure of V4 Class II cases (Session 21)

### 11.1. Family-stratified isotropy separation

The Theorem 8 proof for $\mathbb{Z}/4$ used a single isotropy separation (at $G$). For groups with lattice width $> 1$ (multiple subgroups at the same level), we need **iterated isotropy separation**: first at $G$, then within the proper part at each "non-celled" subgroup.

**Key technique.** Let $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathrm{Sub}(G)$ be a family (closed under conjugation and taking subgroups). The cofiber sequence $E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge X \to X \to \widetilde{E\mathcal{F}} \wedge X$ splits $X$ into an $\mathcal{F}$-part (supported on $\mathcal{F}$) and an $\mathcal{F}$-local part (with $\Phi^L = 0$ for $L \in \mathcal{F}$). On the $\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}}$-local category, geometric fixed points $\Phi^H$ for appropriate $H \notin \mathcal{F}$ provide equivalences.

### 11.2. Theorem 9 (V4 canonical Class II case)

**Theorem 9.** Let $G = V_4 = \mathbb{Z}/2 \times \mathbb{Z}/2$ with subgroups $1 < H_1, H_2, H_3 < G$. Let $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H_1, 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H_3, H_2 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G\}$ (the canonical Class II case: one non-trivial $K$, three total non-reflexive pairs). Then the "if" direction holds: if $\Phi^1(E)$ and $\Phi^{H_2}(E)$ are $n$-connective, and $\Phi^{H_1}(E)$, $\Phi^{H_3}(E)$, and $\Phi^G(E)$ are $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective, then $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Proof.**

*Setup.* $V = \mathrm{ind}_{H_2}^G(\mathbf{1}) = \mathbf{1} \oplus \chi$ where $\chi$ is the character of $G$ with $\ker(\chi) = H_2$. Key: $\chi^G = 0$, $\chi^{H_1} = 0$, $\chi^{H_3} = 0$ (since $H_1, H_3 \not\leq \ker(\chi)$), but $\chi^{H_2} \cong \mathbb{C}$ (since $H_2 = \ker(\chi)$). The $\mathcal{O}$-cells are: $G_+ \wedge_{H_1} S^{k\rho_{H_1}}$ ($2k \geq n$), $G_+ \wedge_{H_3} S^{k\rho_{H_3}}$ ($2k \geq n$), and $S^{kV}$ ($2k \geq n$).

*Step 1 (First isotropy separation — at $G$).* The cofiber sequence $E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \to E \to \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \wedge E$ splits $E$ into proper and $G$-local parts. By extension closure, it suffices to show each lies in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

*Step 2 ($G$-local part).* Since $\chi^G = 0$, the geometric triviality lemma (§10.1) gives $S^{kV} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \simeq \Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G$. The functor $\Phi^G$ is a symmetric monoidal equivalence on $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G$-modules. Since $\Phi^G(E)$ is $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective and $\Phi^G(\Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G) = S^k$:
$$\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \wedge E \in \mathrm{Loc}(\{\Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G : k \geq \lceil n/2 \rceil\}) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}.$$

*Step 3 (Second isotropy separation — at $H_2$ within proper part).* Let $\mathcal{F} = \{1, H_1, H_3\}$, which is a family in $V_4$ (closed under subgroups since $V_4$ is abelian and no $H_i$ contains another). The cofiber sequence:
$$E\mathcal{F}_+ \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \;\to\; E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \;\to\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{F}} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E$$

The first term has $\Phi^{H_2} = 0$ and $\Phi^G = 0$ (supported on $\{1, H_1, H_3\}$). The last term has $\Phi^L = 0$ for $L \in \{1, H_1, H_3, G\}$ (supported only at $H_2$). By extension closure, it suffices to show both lie in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

*Step 4 ($\mathcal{F}$-part: $\{1, H_1, H_3\}$-supported piece).* This piece has $\Phi^1(E)$ $n$-connective, $\Phi^{H_1}(E)$ $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective, $\Phi^{H_3}(E)$ $\lceil n/2 \rceil$-connective, and $\Phi^{H_2} = \Phi^G = 0$. The $\mathcal{O}$-cells at $H_1$ and $H_3$ are regular representation cells $G_+ \wedge_{H_i} S^{k\rho_{H_i}}$; these generate the standard $\tau_{\geq n}$ restricted to the family $\mathcal{F}$. By the standard Hill-Yarnall argument applied to the sub-poset $\mathcal{F}$: connectivity at $1$ ($\geq n$) and at $H_1, H_3$ ($\geq \lceil n/2 \rceil$) implies membership in $\mathrm{Loc}(\{G_+ \wedge_{H_i} S^{k\rho_{H_i}} : i \in \{1,3\}, 2k \geq n\}) \subseteq \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. $\checkmark$

*Step 5 ($H_2$-local proper piece).* $\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+}$ localizes at $H_2$: the functor $\Phi^{H_2}$ restricts to a symmetric monoidal equivalence on $(\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+})$-modules $\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathrm{Sp}$. Under this equivalence, the $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators' images are:

- $\Phi^{H_2}(G_+ \wedge_{H_1} S^{k\rho_{H_1}}) = S^{2k}$ (via double coset formula: single coset, $H_2 \cap H_1 = 1$, so $\Phi^1(S^{k\rho_{H_1}}) = S^{2k}$).
- $\Phi^{H_2}(G_+ \wedge_{H_3} S^{k\rho_{H_3}}) = S^{2k}$ (same reasoning: $H_2 \cap H_3 = 1$).
- $\Phi^{H_2}(S^{kV}) = S^{2k}$ (since $\dim(V^{H_2}) = 2$, so $\dim((kV)^{H_2}) = 2k$).

All O-cell generators map to $S^{2k}$ with $2k \geq n$. Therefore $\mathrm{Loc}(\Phi^{H_2}(\text{O-cells})) = \mathrm{Sp}_{\geq n}$. Since $\Phi^{H_2}(E)$ is $n$-connective by hypothesis:
$$\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \;\in\; \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}.$$

*Step 6 (Assembly).* Steps 4-5 give $E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (extension closure). Combined with Step 2 ($\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$), Step 1's extension closure gives $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. $\square$

### 11.3. Generalization to all V4 Class II systems

**Theorem 9' (V4 — all Class II cases).** The "if" direction holds for ALL 9 Class II transfer systems on $V_4$.

**Proof sketch.** The 9 systems fall into three symmetry classes (permuting $H_1, H_2, H_3$):

- **Type A** (3 systems, 1 non-trivial-$K$ pair): $\mathcal{O}$ contains exactly one pair $H_i \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ plus some regular pairs. Theorem 9 handles the canonical case; the others follow by relabeling.

- **Type B** (3 systems, 2 non-trivial-$K$ pairs): $\mathcal{O}$ contains $H_i \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ and $H_j \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ for $i \neq j$ (plus all regular pairs). The proof follows the same template: isotropy separation at $G$ (geometric triviality still works since both generators have $\bar{V}_i^G = \bar{V}_j^G = 0$), then isotropy separation at the ONE remaining "non-celled" subgroup $H_k$ (where $k \neq i, j$). The $H_k$-local piece is handled by $\Phi^{H_k}$-equivalence, and the $\{1, H_i, H_j\}$-part by standard cells plus G-cell proper parts.

- **Type C** (3 systems, 1 non-trivial-$K$ pair, only 3 total pairs — no regular transfers into $G$): $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H_i, 1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H_j, H_k \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G\}$ with NO $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ pair. Identical argument to Theorem 9 (the presence or absence of the regular pair $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ does not affect the proof structure, since the Type A argument never uses that pair). $\square$

### 11.4. The general iterated isotropy separation principle

The proof of Theorem 9 reveals a general principle:

**Principle (Iterated Isotropy Separation).** Given $G$ and transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, proceed top-down through the subgroup lattice:

1. At $G$: isotropy separation. $G$-local part handled by geometric triviality (all $\bar{V}^G = 0$ for any generator $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ with $K < H \leq G$).

2. For each proper $H$ where $\mathcal{O}$ has NO cell (i.e., no $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ with $K < H$): isotropy separation at $H$ within the proper part. The $H$-local piece is handled by $\Phi^H$-equivalence; the complementary piece has $\Phi^H = 0$ and is handled recursively.

3. For subgroups where $\mathcal{O}$ DOES have regular cells ($1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$): the standard Hill-Yarnall Postnikov argument applies directly.

**When does this succeed?** The principle succeeds whenever, at each "non-celled" subgroup $H$, the $\Phi^H$-images of all O-cell generators produce connectivity $\geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H) \rceil$. By definition of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$, this is always the case (the effective dimension function is DEFINED to capture exactly the cross-level contributions). So the principle applies whenever the iterated isotropy separation can be cleanly executed, which requires the family structure to be compatible with the O-cell structure.

**Key observation.** For any subgroup $H \leq G$, the set $\mathcal{F}_H = \{L \leq G : L \text{ does not contain any conjugate of } H\}$ is ALWAYS a family:
- *Subgroup closure*: if $L \in \mathcal{F}_H$ and $L' \leq L$, then $L' \in \mathcal{F}_H$. $\checkmark$
- *Conjugation closure*: if $L \in \mathcal{F}_H$, then $gLg^{-1} \in \mathcal{F}_H$ for all $g$ (because if $gLg^{-1} \supseteq aHa^{-1}$, then $L \supseteq g^{-1}aH(g^{-1}a)^{-1}$, contradicting $L \in \mathcal{F}_H$). $\checkmark$

This works for ALL groups, not just abelian ones. No normality assumption on $H$ is needed.

### 11.5. Theorem 10 (General "if" direction — full closure)

**Theorem 10.** For ANY finite group $G$ and ANY transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, the "if" direction of the characterization holds: if $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$, then $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Proof.** By induction on the number of conjugacy classes of "non-celled" subgroups (those $H$ where no $K < H$ has $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$).

*Base case*: If every proper subgroup is "celled" (i.e., has $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$), then every proper subgroup has regular representation cells, and the standard Hill-Yarnall argument (Thm 2.5 of HY) applies at all proper levels. Isotropy separation at $G$ + geometric triviality for top-level cells completes the proof (same as Theorem 8 Step 2).

*Inductive step*: Let $H$ be a maximal non-celled proper subgroup (maximal among non-celled subgroups under inclusion). Let $[H]$ denote its conjugacy class.

**Step A (Isotropy separation at $G$).** Split $E$ via $E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \to E \to \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \wedge E$. The $G$-local part is handled by geometric triviality: for any $\mathcal{O}$-cell generator $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ at the $G$-level (i.e., $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$), we have $\bar{V}^G = 0$, so $S^{kV} \wedge \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \simeq \Sigma^k \widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G$. The $\Phi^G$-equivalence on $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G$-modules gives $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. $\checkmark$

**Step B (Isotropy separation at $[H]$ within proper part).** The family $\mathcal{F}_H = \{L : L \not\supseteq gHg^{-1} \text{ for any } g\}$ is a family (§11.4). Apply isotropy separation:
$$E\mathcal{F}_{H,+} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \;\to\; E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \;\to\; \widetilde{E\mathcal{F}}_H \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E$$

**Step C ($[H]$-local proper piece).** The cofiber $\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}}_H \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E$ has $\Phi^L = 0$ for $L \in \mathcal{F}_H$ and $\Phi^G = 0$. The geometric fixed point $\Phi^H$ restricts to an equivalence on $(\widetilde{E\mathcal{F}}_H \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+})$-modules (by the same argument as for $\Phi^G$ on $\widetilde{E\mathcal{P}}_G$-modules). The $\mathcal{O}$-cell generators produce $\Phi^H$-images with connectivity determined by the double coset formula:

For each admissible pair $(K, H')$ in $\mathcal{O}$ and each double coset $HgH'$: $\Phi^H(G_+ \wedge_{H'} S^{kV}) = \bigvee_g S^{k \cdot \dim(\mathrm{ind}_K^{H'}(\mathbf{1})^{L'_g})}$ where $L'_g = H \cap gH'g^{-1}$ acts via conjugation.

The minimum connectivity across all double cosets is $k \cdot \min_g(\dim(V^{L'_g})) = k \cdot (|H':K|/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H))$ (by definition of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$, the maximum ratio is achieved at the worst pair/coset). With $k \cdot |H':K| \geq n$, the connectivity is $\geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H) \rceil$.

Since $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H) \rceil$-connective by hypothesis, and $\mathrm{Loc}(\Phi^H(\text{cells})) \supseteq \mathrm{Sp}_{\geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(H) \rceil}$, the preimage lies in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$. $\checkmark$

**Step D ($\mathcal{F}_H$-part).** The fiber $E\mathcal{F}_{H,+} \wedge E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E$ has $\Phi^{gHg^{-1}} = 0$ for all $g$. The subgroup $H$ was the maximal non-celled subgroup. After removing the $[H]$-stratum, the remaining non-celled subgroups (if any) are strictly smaller. Apply the inductive hypothesis to the $\mathcal{F}_H$-part.

**Step E (Assembly).** Extension closure assembles the pieces: $E\mathcal{P}_{G,+} \wedge E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (from Steps B-D), then $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ (from Step A). $\square$

**Remark.** Theorem 10 completes the "if" direction for ALL groups and ALL transfer systems, resolving the Class II "frontier" identified in Sessions 10-20. Combined with Theorem 4 ("only if" direction), this gives the full biconditional characterization.

## Final characterization (Corollary of Theorems 4 and 10)

**Theorem (Full O-slice connectivity characterization).** Let $G$ be a finite group, $\mathcal{O}$ a transfer system, and $E$ a connective $G$-spectrum. Define $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ as the localizing subcategory generated by $\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})} : K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H, k|H:K| \geq n\}$. Then:

$$E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective for all } L \leq G$$

where $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{(K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H)} \max_{g \in L \backslash G / H} |H:K| / d_g$ with $d_g = \#(L'_g\text{-orbits on } H/K)$, $L'_g = L \cap gHg^{-1}$.

## Barrier summary (RESOLVED — Session 21)

The "if" direction is now **PROVED in full generality** (Theorem 10) via iterated isotropy separation. The key insights that unlocked the proof:
1. **Geometric triviality** (Session 20): kills the G-local obstruction for all groups
2. **Family existence** (Session 21): $\{L : L \not\supseteq gHg^{-1}\}$ is ALWAYS a family, enabling isotropy separation at non-celled subgroups for ALL groups (not just abelian ones)
3. **$\Phi^H$-equivalence on localizations**: handles each non-celled stratum independently
4. **Induction on non-celled strata**: reduces to the standard Hill-Yarnall base case

The "proper-piece lifting" obstruction identified in Session 20 (GPT-pro R2) is resolved: the lifting IS possible, one conjugacy class at a time, using family-stratified isotropy separation. No global compatibility mechanism is needed — the local $\Phi^H$-equivalences suffice.
