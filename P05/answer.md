## 1. Problem statement

Fix a finite group $G$. Let $\mathcal{O}$ denote an incomplete transfer system associated to an $N_\infty$ operad. Define the slice filtration on the $G$-equivariant stable category adapted to $\mathcal{O}$ and state and prove a characterization of the $\mathcal{O}$-slice connectivity of a connective $G$-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

## 3. Answer: Two candidate O-adapted definitions + characterizations

### 3.1. Key construction: O-dimension function

For a transfer system $\mathcal{O}$ on $G$ (viewed as a partial order on $\mathrm{Sub}(G)$), define the **$\mathcal{O}$-dimension function** $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}: \mathrm{Sub}(G) \to \mathbb{N}$ by:

$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max\{|H:K| \;:\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$$

where $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ means there is an $\mathcal{O}$-transfer from $K$ to $H$, implying $K \subseteq H$.

**Properties**:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq 1$ always ($H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ by reflexivity).
- For the **complete** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H|$ (since $1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ for all $H$).
- For the **trivial** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = 1$ (only $H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$).
- Well-defined and conjugation-invariant (by closure properties of transfer systems).

### 3.2. Candidate A: O-slice filtration via O-cells

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration)**. Define $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ to be the localizing subcategory of genuine $G$-spectra generated by:

$$\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_{K}^{H}(\mathbf{1})} \;:\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H, \; H \leq G, \; k \cdot |H:K| \geq n\}$$

where $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ is the permutation representation of $H$ on $H/K$.

**Characterization (Candidate A)**. A connective $G$-spectrum $E$ is $\mathcal{O}$-slice $n$-connective (i.e., $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$) if and only if:

$$\Phi^H(E) \text{ is } \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil\text{-connective for all } H \leq G.$$

**Calibration**:
- Complete transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H|$, recovers $\lceil n/|H| \rceil$ (Hill-Yarnall Thm 2.5). PASS.
- Trivial transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = 1$, gives $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H$. This is the naive/orbit-wise Postnikov baseline (no norms available, connectivity is measured orbit-by-orbit). PASS.
- For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$: there are exactly 2 transfer systems (complete and trivial), and Candidate A interpolates correctly between the two. PASS.

**Bottleneck for proof**: Need to establish that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is indeed a localizing subcategory (closure under extensions and filtered colimits), and that the geometric fixed-point characterization holds. The "only if" direction reduces to computing $\Phi^H$ on generators. The "if" direction requires showing that the $\Phi^H$-connectivity condition implies membership in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, which typically uses a Postnikov-type induction on the orbit filtration.

### 3.3. Candidate B: O-slice filtration via O-regular representation

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-regular representation)**. For $H \leq G$, define the $\mathcal{O}$-regular representation recursively:
- $\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}} = \mathrm{ind}_{K_{\min}}^H(\mathbf{1})$, where $K_{\min}$ is the minimal $\mathcal{O}$-transferable subgroup of $H$ (i.e., the smallest $K$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$).
- $\dim(\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}) = |H:K_{\min}| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H)$.

**Definition ($\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration)**. $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the localizing subcategory generated by $\{G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}} : H \leq G, \; k \cdot \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq n\}$.

**Characterization (Candidate B)**: Same as Candidate A (same dimension function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$).

**Key difference from A**: Candidate B uses a single "canonical" representation per orbit $G/H$, while Candidate A uses all representations from O-admissible inductions. This matters when there are multiple minimal transferable subgroups.

**Bottleneck**: When $H$ has multiple incomparable $\mathcal{O}$-minimal subgroups, $K_{\min}$ is not unique, so $\rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}$ depends on a choice. This makes Candidate A more canonical.

### 3.4. Comparison and recommendation

| Feature | Candidate A | Candidate B |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Generator set | All O-admissible inductions | Single canonical rep per orbit |
| Choice-free? | YES | NO (when multiple minimals) |
| Calibration (complete) | PASS | PASS |
| Calibration (trivial) | PASS | PASS |
| Proof difficulty | Moderate (larger generator set) | Moderate (canonical but may miss cells) |

**Recommendation**: **Candidate A** is preferred because it is choice-free and naturally incorporates all $\mathcal{O}$-structure. The characterization theorem has the same statement for both.

### 3.5. Proof sketch for Candidate A

**Claim**: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ if and only if $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**"Only if" direction**: It suffices to check the characterization on generators. For a generator $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $k|H:K| \geq n$:
- $\Phi^L(G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot |(gH/gK)^{L \cap gHg^{-1}}|}$
- The fixed-point dimension $|(H/K)^{L'}|$ (with $L' = L \cap gHg^{-1}$) gives connectivity $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}|$.
- We need $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}| \geq \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ for all $L$ and all double coset representatives $g$.

**"Only if" — obstruction for intermediate transfer systems (Session 7)**: The inequality $k \cdot |(H/K)^{L'}| \geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ FAILS for certain intermediate transfer systems on groups with $\geq 3$ subgroups. Counterexample:

- $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, transfer system $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$ (transfers at the bottom level only).
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$ (no proper transfer into $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$).
- Generator: $G_+ \wedge_{\mathbb{Z}/p} S^{k\rho}$ with $\rho = \mathrm{ind}_1^{\mathbb{Z}/p}(\mathbf{1})$ (regular rep of $\mathbb{Z}/p$), $k \cdot p \geq n$.
- $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}$: single double coset ($G$ abelian), $L' = \mathbb{Z}/p$, $\dim(\rho^{\mathbb{Z}/p}) = 1$.
- Connectivity at $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$: $k \cdot 1 = k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil$.
- Required: $k \geq \lceil n/1 \rceil = n$ (since $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$).
- But $k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil < n$ for $p \geq 2$, $n > 1$. **FAILS.**

**Consequence**: The characterization $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective is NOT valid as the "only if" direction for Candidate A's generators with arbitrary $(H, K)$ pairs. The generator set is too permissive: $\mathcal{O}$-cells from intermediate subgroups $H$ can have coarser connectivity at larger subgroups $L > H$ than the characterization demands.

**Valid special cases**: The characterization IS correct for:
- $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (only 2 subgroups; no intermediate transfer systems exist). Both the complete and trivial systems reduce to known results (HY Thm 2.5 and Postnikov respectively).
- The **complete** transfer system on any $G$: reduces to HY Thm 2.5 (verified by construction).
- The **trivial** transfer system on any $G$: reduces to orbit-wise Postnikov (verified by construction).

**Possible fixes**:
1. **Restrict the generator set**: Only allow generators from $(H, K)$ where $K$ achieves the maximum index $|H:K| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H)$ at ALL subgroups simultaneously (essentially Candidate B). This shrinks $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.
2. **Modify the characterization**: Replace $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ with a more refined dimension function that accounts for the interaction between $\mathcal{O}$-transfers at different levels.
3. **Use a different definition of O-slice filtration**: Define $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ using generators $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \rho_H^{\mathcal{O}}}$ with $k \cdot \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \geq n$ AND the additional constraint $k \geq \lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L) \rceil$ for all $L \leq G$ such that $H$ is subconjugate to $L$.

Option 3 is the most conservative but potentially circular. The correct fix likely involves defining an "effective O-dimension function" that tracks the minimum fixed-point dimension across all subgroups.

**"If" direction**: Standard argument via the equivariant Whitehead theorem adapted to the $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells. If $\Phi^H(E)$ is sufficiently connective for all $H$, then $E$ can be built from $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells by a Postnikov-type construction.
- **Gap**: Requires showing the $\mathcal{O}$-slice cells detect all equivalences, i.e., that $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the right localizing subcategory.
- **Note**: The "if" direction is independent of the "only if" obstruction above — it concerns the converse implication.

## 5. What is defined vs unresolved

**Defined (this cycle)**:
- $\mathcal{O}$-dimension function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max\{|H:K| : K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$
- $\mathcal{O}$-slice filtration (two candidates, A preferred)
- Characterization statement: $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H$

**Unresolved**:
1. **Characterization obstruction identified**: The "only if" direction FAILS for intermediate transfer systems on groups with ≥3 subgroups (§3.5 counterexample: $\mathcal{O}_2$ on $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$). Either the generator set or the connectivity bound needs modification. The characterization IS valid for $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ and for the complete/trivial transfer systems on any $G$.
2. **Uniqueness of O-slice filtration**: Whether Candidates A and B generate the same localizing subcategory when multiple O-minimal subgroups exist. The counterexample in §3.5 suggests they may NOT coincide for intermediate systems.
3. **Correct dimension function**: The function $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max\{|H:K| : K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H\}$ does not account for how fixed-point dimensions propagate across the subgroup lattice. An "effective O-dimension function" incorporating these interactions is needed for the general characterization.

## 6. Formal results (Session 8)

### Theorem 1 (Obstruction for intermediate transfer systems)

**Statement**: Let $G$ be a finite group with a subgroup chain $1 < K < H < G$ such that $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ (i.e., $K$ transfers to $H$) but $H \not\leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ (i.e., $H$ does NOT transfer to $G$) and no other proper subgroup of $G$ is $\mathcal{O}$-transferable to $G$. Then the "only if" direction of the characterization "$E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \Rightarrow \Phi^G(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(G) \rceil$-connective" FAILS.

**Proof**:

Since $H \not\leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ and only $G \leq_{\mathcal{O}} G$ (reflexivity), we have $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(G) = 1$, so the characterization demands $\Phi^G(E)$ is $n$-connective.

Consider the generator $E_0 = G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$. By construction $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$, so $E_0 \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

Apply $\Phi^G$ to $E_0$. By the double coset formula:
$$\Phi^G(G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot V}) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in G \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot \dim(V^{G \cap gHg^{-1}})}$$
where $V = \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})$ has $\dim V = |H:K|$.

The fixed-point dimension $\dim(V^{G \cap gHg^{-1}})$ counts the number of cosets $hK$ fixed by the subgroup $G \cap gHg^{-1}$ acting on $H/K$. When $G$ is abelian (as in $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$), this gives $\dim(V^H) = |\{hK : H \subseteq hKh^{-1}\}|$. Since $K < H$ and $K$ is normal in $H$ for the cyclic case, $\dim(V^H) = 1$ (only the coset $K$ itself is fixed).

Therefore $\Phi^G(E_0)$ has connectivity $k \cdot 1 = k$. Since $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$, we get $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil$. For $|H:K| \geq 2$ and $n > 1$: $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil < n$, contradicting the required $n$-connectivity.

**Concrete instance**: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $K = 1$, $H = \mathbb{Z}/p$, $\mathcal{O} = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$. Then $|H:K| = p$, $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$, and $k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil < n$ for $p \geq 2$, $n > 1$. $\square$

### Theorem 2 (Positive scope: complete and trivial transfer systems)

**Statement**: For any finite group $G$:
- (a) **Complete transfer system**: The characterization holds. $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/|H| \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.
- (b) **Trivial transfer system**: The characterization holds. $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**Proof of (a)**: For the complete transfer system, $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ for all $K \leq H$, so $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = \max_{K \leq H} |H:K| = |H:1| = |H|$. The generator set of $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ includes all $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $K \leq H$ and $k|H:K| \geq n$. In particular, taking $K = 1$ gives $\mathrm{ind}_1^H(\mathbf{1}) = \rho_H$ (the regular representation). So $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}}$ contains all generators of the standard slice filtration $\tau_{\geq n}$. Conversely, every $\mathcal{O}_{\max}$-generator is a wedge summand of a standard generator (since $\mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1}) \hookrightarrow \rho_H$ as representations). Therefore $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\max}} = \tau_{\geq n}$, and the characterization reduces to Hill-Yarnall Theorem 2.5 (§2.7, CITE_ONLY). $\square$

**Proof of (b)**: For the trivial transfer system, only $H \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ (reflexivity). So $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) = |H:H| = 1$ for all $H$. The generators are $G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_H^H(\mathbf{1})} = G_+ \wedge_H S^k$ with $k \cdot 1 \geq n$, i.e., $k \geq n$. This is the orbit-wise Postnikov filtration: $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}_{\min}}$ is generated by suspensions $\Sigma^n(G/H_+)$.

"Only if": For $E = G_+ \wedge_H S^k$ with $k \geq n$, we have $\Phi^L(E) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G/H} S^k$ which is $k$-connective, and $k \geq n = \lceil n/1 \rceil$. Extends to all objects in the localizing subcategory by closure under extensions and filtered colimits.

"If": If $\Phi^H(E)$ is $n$-connective for all $H$, then $E$ is $n$-connective on all orbits, which is precisely the condition for $E$ to lie in the orbit-wise Postnikov $n$-connective part. $\square$

### Theorem 3 (Positive scope: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$)

**Statement**: For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (prime $p$) and ANY transfer system $\mathcal{O}$, the characterization holds: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ iff $\Phi^H(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(H) \rceil$-connective for all $H \leq G$.

**Proof**: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ has exactly two subgroups: $\{1\}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/p$. The lattice of transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$ has exactly two elements:

- **Complete**: $\{1\} \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p$ (i.e., $\{1\}$ transfers to $\mathbb{Z}/p$). This is the only non-reflexive transfer relation possible, and it satisfies the closure axioms. By Theorem 2(a), the characterization holds.

- **Trivial**: only reflexive relations. By Theorem 2(b), the characterization holds.

Since these are the only two transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$ (a group with only two subgroups admits no intermediate transfer system), the characterization holds for ALL transfer systems on $\mathbb{Z}/p$. $\square$

**Remark**: The key reason $\mathbb{Z}/p$ avoids the obstruction of Theorem 1 is that the subgroup chain $1 < K < H < G$ required in the obstruction theorem needs at least 3 proper subgroup levels, which $\mathbb{Z}/p$ does not have.

### Theorem 4 (Corrected "only if" with effective dimension function)

**Definition (Effective $\mathcal{O}$-dimension function)**. For $L \leq G$, define:
$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{\substack{(H,K):\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H}} \;\max_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} \frac{|H:K|}{|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|}$$
where $|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|$ is the number of $(L \cap gHg^{-1})$-orbits on the coset space $H/K$, with $L \cap gHg^{-1}$ acting via the inclusion $L \cap gHg^{-1} \leq gHg^{-1} \cong H$.

**Properties**:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \geq \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ always (take $H = L$, $g = 1$, giving $|L:K|/|L \backslash (L/K)| = |L:K|/1 = |L:K|$, maximized at $K$ achieving $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$).
- For the **complete** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = |L| = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ (verified: $(H,K) = (L,1)$ gives $|L|/1 = |L|$; no larger ratio from other pairs).
- For the **trivial** transfer system: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = 1 = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ (only $(H,H)$ pairs, ratio $= 1$).
- For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}} = \nu_{\mathcal{O}}$ (only 2 transfer systems, both extremal).
- **Strict inequality**: For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$: $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$ (from $(H,K) = (\mathbb{Z}/p, 1)$: ratio $= p/1 = p$), while $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$.

**Statement**: For any $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ and any $L \leq G$:
$$\Phi^L(E) \text{ is } \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil\text{-connective.}$$

**Proof**:

*Step 1 (Target set is localizing).* For each $L \leq G$ and integer $m \geq 0$, the set $S_m^L = \{E : \Phi^L(E) \text{ is } m\text{-connective}\}$ is a localizing subcategory. Proof: $\Phi^L$ is exact (preserves cofiber sequences) and commutes with filtered colimits. Closure under extensions: if $A \to B \to C$ is exact with $\Phi^L(A)$, $\Phi^L(C)$ both $m$-connective, then for $k < m$ the long exact sequence gives $\pi_k(\Phi^L(A)) \to \pi_k(\Phi^L(B)) \to \pi_k(\Phi^L(C))$, and both outer terms vanish, so $\pi_k(\Phi^L(B)) = 0$. Therefore $S = \bigcap_{L \leq G} S_{\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)\rceil}^L$ is localizing.

*Step 2 (Generators lie in S).* Take a generator $E_0 = G_+ \wedge_H S^{k \cdot \mathrm{ind}_K^H(\mathbf{1})}$ with $K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H$ and $k \cdot |H:K| \geq n$. By the double coset formula:
$$\Phi^L(E_0) \simeq \bigvee_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} S^{k \cdot d_g}, \quad d_g = |(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|$$
The connectivity of $\Phi^L(E_0)$ is $\min_{[g]} k \cdot d_g$. Since $k \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil$:
$$k \cdot d_g \geq \lceil n/|H:K| \rceil \cdot d_g \geq \lceil n \cdot d_g / |H:K| \rceil = \lceil n / (|H:K|/d_g) \rceil \geq \lceil n / \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$$
where the last inequality uses $|H:K|/d_g \leq \nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ (by definition of $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ as the max over all such ratios).

*Step 3 (Conclusion).* Since $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$ is the localizing subcategory generated by the O-cells, and every O-cell lies in $S$ (Step 2), and $S$ is localizing (Step 1): $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \subseteq S$. $\square$

**Remark**: Theorem 4 resolves the Theorem 1 obstruction. For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$, $\mathcal{O}_2$: the characterization with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = p$ demands only $\lceil n/p \rceil$-connectivity at $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}$, which the generators DO achieve. Theorem 1's failure was caused by using $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$, which demanded $n$-connectivity.

| Transfer system | Group class | Characterization | Status |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Complete ($\mathcal{O}_{\max}$) | Any $G$ | HOLDS (with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$) | **Theorem 2(a)** |
| Trivial ($\mathcal{O}_{\min}$) | Any $G$ | HOLDS (with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$) | **Theorem 2(b)** |
| Any $\mathcal{O}$ | $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ | HOLDS (with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$) | **Theorem 3** |
| Intermediate $\mathcal{O}$ with chain $1 < K < H < G$ | $|G| \geq p^2$ | FAILS with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$ ("only if") | **Theorem 1** |
| Any $\mathcal{O}$ | Any $G$ | "Only if" HOLDS with $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ | **Theorem 4** |

### 6.2. Corrected general characterization

The obstruction in Theorem 1 arises because $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}(L)$ measures only the transfers INTO $L$, not how generators from smaller subgroups $H$ interact with $\Phi^L$.

**Theorem 4** (above) proves the corrected "only if" direction using the effective dimension function:
$$\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \max_{\substack{(H,K):\; K \leq_{\mathcal{O}} H}} \;\max_{[g] \in L \backslash G / H} \frac{|H:K|}{|(L \cap gHg^{-1}) \backslash (H/K)|}$$

**Proved ("only if")**: $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}} \Rightarrow \Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$. (Theorem 4.)

**Conjecture ("if" direction)**: $\Phi^L(E)$ is $\lceil n/\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) \rceil$-connective for all $L \leq G$ $\Rightarrow$ $E \in \tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$.

**Status**: "Only if" proved (Theorem 4). "If" direction remains open — requires showing that the $\mathcal{O}$-cells detect all equivalences in $\tau_{\geq n}^{\mathcal{O}}$, likely via an equivariant Whitehead argument adapted to the $\mathcal{O}$-cell structure.

**Note**: The earlier conjectured formula $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}^{\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \min_{(H,K)} |H:K|/|(H/K)^L|$ (with $L \leq_G H$) was incorrect — the correct formula uses MAX over all $(H,K)$ pairs and all double coset representatives, measuring the worst-case dimension ratio across all generators.
