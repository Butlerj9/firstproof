# Answer: P05

**Status**: ❌ Parked
**Reviewer**: Codex supervisor audit — park confirmed (definition-level block + open-ended formulation)
**External deps**: Unresolved (`Blumberg-Hill` N∞/transfer-system foundations, slice-filtration references)

## Problem statement

Question: define an O-adapted slice filtration and prove an O-slice connectivity characterization via geometric fixed points.

## Outcome

No proof-level completion was reached in this sprint lane.

The lane was parked at G2 because the problem requires definition-accurate foundations from primary references that were not available in the active llm-only track.

## What is established

- G0 formalization completed.
- G1 dependency map completed.
- G2 route map completed.

## What is unresolved

- Precise canonical definition of the O-adapted slice filtration used by the problem.
- The characterization theorem statement with proof and statement-number citations.
