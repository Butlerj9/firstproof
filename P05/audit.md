# Audit: P05 — O-slice connectivity characterization via geometric fixed points

## G0 Formalize

**Status**: ✅ Complete.

### Problem restatement

Fix a finite group G. Let O denote an **incomplete transfer system** associated to an N∞ operad.

**Tasks**:
1. **Define** the slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category adapted to O.
2. **State and prove** a characterization of the O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

### Object glossary

| Symbol | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| G | Finite group | Fixed throughout |
| N∞ operad | G-equivariant operad | Encodes which norms/transfers are available; interpolates between naive and genuine equivariant structure |
| O | Incomplete transfer system | Partial order on Sub(G) refining inclusion, closed under conjugation and restriction (Rubin Def 3.4) |
| G-equivariant stable category | Stable ∞-category | G-spectra; objects have genuine fixed points Φ^H for all H ≤ G |
| Slice filtration | Filtration on G-spectra | Tower P^n → P^{n-1} → ⋯ with slices P^n_n capturing "dimension n" information |
| O-slice connectivity | Connectivity notion | Adapted connectivity measuring when a G-spectrum is "n-connected" relative to the transfer system O |
| Geometric fixed points Φ^H | Functor | For H ≤ G: Φ^H(X) = (X ∧ ẼP[H])^H where ẼP[H] is a universal space |
| Connective G-spectrum | Object in equivariant stable category | Underlying homotopy groups π_n^H(X) = 0 for n < 0, for all H ≤ G |

### Truth mode

- [x] EXPLORE BOTH (50% YES / 50% — this is a "state and prove" problem, so the answer must exist by design)

**Note**: This problem asks to **state** a characterization (not just prove one). The characterization itself is part of the answer. The problem has a known answer (the authors have a proof ≤ 5 pages).

### Experiment plan

| Phase | Task | Pass/Fail |
|-------|------|-----------|
| EXP-1 | For G = Z/2 and O = complete transfer system, recover the standard slice filtration characterization | ✅ PASS (ν_O(Z/2) = 2 = |Z/2|, matches HY Thm 2.5) |
| EXP-2 | For G = Z/2 and O = trivial (no nontrivial transfers), determine what the characterization should reduce to | ✅ PASS (ν_O(H) = 1 for all H, gives orbit-wise Postnikov baseline) |
| EXP-3 | For G = Z/p: interpolation between complete and trivial | ✅ PASS (exactly 2 transfer systems, ν_O interpolates correctly) |

## G1 Background

| Blumberg-Hill (2015), arXiv:1309.1750 | ✅ RESOLVED | N∞ operad def, indexing system def, admissible set def, classification | NO | CITE_ONLY ingest: Def 3.7, 3.22, 4.3, Thm 3.24 |

### Known facts (resolved from primary sources)

1. **N∞ operad** (BH Def 3.7): G-operad with G-contractible O_0, free Σ_n actions, and universal spaces for families F_n(O).
2. **Indexing system** (BH Def 3.22, Rubin Def 2.1): Collection of finite G-sets closed under 7 operations.
3. **Transfer system** (Rubin Def 3.4): Partial order on Sub(G) refining inclusion, closed under conjugation and restriction.
4. **Equivalence** (Rubin Thm 3.7): Indexing systems ↔ transfer systems, inverse order isomorphisms.
5. **Slice connectivity** (HY Def 1.1): τ_{≥n} generated by G_+ ∧_H S^{kρ_H} with k|H| ≥ n.
6. **Geometric FP characterization** (HY Thm 2.5): E ∈ τ_{≥n} iff Φ^H(E) is ⌈n/|H|⌉-connective for all H ≤ G.
7. **Dimension function** (HY Def 2.6): ν̄_n(G/H) = ⌈n/|H|⌉.

## G2 Route Map

**Status**: ✅ Two candidates formulated and calibrated.

### Route A (PREFERRED): O-cells with all admissible inductions

**Definition**: τ_{≥n}^O generated by {G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ind_K^H(1)} : K ≤_O H, k·|H:K| ≥ n}.

**Characterization**: E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O iff Φ^H(E) is ⌈n/ν_O(H)⌉-connective for all H ≤ G, where ν_O(H) = max{|H:K| : K ≤_O H}.

- Choice-free: YES
- Calibration (complete): PASS
- Calibration (trivial): PASS
- Calibration (Z/p): PASS

**Bottleneck theorem**: Need orbit-counting argument for "only if" and equivariant Whitehead argument for "if".

**Fail condition**: If the localizing subcategory τ_{≥n}^O doesn't yield a well-behaved filtration (i.e., slices don't exist or the tower doesn't converge).

### Route B: O-regular representation (single canonical rep per orbit)

**Definition**: τ_{≥n}^O generated by {G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ρ_H^O} : H ≤ G, k·ν_O(H) ≥ n}, where ρ_H^O = ind_{K_min}^H(1) for a minimal O-transferable subgroup K_min.

**Same characterization** as Route A.

**Fail condition**: Multiple incomparable O-minimal subgroups → non-canonical choice → Route B is not well-defined.

### Route C: Direct Z/p computation (most tractable for partial proof)

Compute explicitly for G = Z/p with complete and trivial systems, verify the characterization matches, then generalize by induction on the subgroup lattice.

## Decision: 🟡 CANDIDATE (upgraded from ❌ PARKED)

**Rationale**:
- All 8+ external definition dependencies resolved via CITE_ONLY ingest.
- Two concrete candidate definitions formulated.
- Both pass calibration tests at complete, trivial, and Z/p transfer systems.
- Characterization statement is explicit and testable.
- Proof gaps identified but bounded: orbit-counting + equivariant Whitehead.
- The ν_O dimension function construction is novel and well-motivated.

**Remaining blockers for ✅**:
1. Complete proof of characterization (both directions).
2. Verify A and B generate the same localizing subcategory.
3. Establish filtration properties (existence of slices, convergence).
