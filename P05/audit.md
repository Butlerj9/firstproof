# Audit: P05 — O-slice connectivity characterization via geometric fixed points

## G0 Formalize

**Status**: ✅ Complete.

### Problem restatement

Fix a finite group G. Let O denote an **incomplete transfer system** associated to an N∞ operad.

**Tasks**:
1. **Define** the slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category adapted to O.
2. **State and prove** a characterization of the O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum in terms of the geometric fixed points.

### Object glossary

| Symbol | Type | Definition |
|--------|------|------------|
| G | Finite group | Fixed throughout |
| N∞ operad | G-equivariant operad | Encodes which norms/transfers are available; interpolates between naive and genuine equivariant structure |
| O | Incomplete transfer system | Partial order on Sub(G) refining inclusion, closed under conjugation and restriction (Rubin Def 3.4) |
| G-equivariant stable category | Stable ∞-category | G-spectra; objects have genuine fixed points Φ^H for all H ≤ G |
| Slice filtration | Filtration on G-spectra | Tower P^n → P^{n-1} → ⋯ with slices P^n_n capturing "dimension n" information |
| O-slice connectivity | Connectivity notion | Adapted connectivity measuring when a G-spectrum is "n-connected" relative to the transfer system O |
| Geometric fixed points Φ^H | Functor | For H ≤ G: Φ^H(X) = (X ∧ ẼP[H])^H where ẼP[H] is a universal space |
| Connective G-spectrum | Object in equivariant stable category | Underlying homotopy groups π_n^H(X) = 0 for n < 0, for all H ≤ G |

### Truth mode

- [x] EXPLORE BOTH (50% YES / 50% — this is a "state and prove" problem, so the answer must exist by design)

**Note**: This problem asks to **state** a characterization (not just prove one). The characterization itself is part of the answer. The problem has a known answer (the authors have a proof ≤ 5 pages).

### Experiment plan

| Phase | Task | Pass/Fail |
|-------|------|-----------|
| EXP-1 | For G = Z/2 and O = complete transfer system, recover the standard slice filtration characterization | ✅ PASS (ν_O(Z/2) = 2 = |Z/2|, matches HY Thm 2.5) |
| EXP-2 | For G = Z/2 and O = trivial (no nontrivial transfers), determine what the characterization should reduce to | ✅ PASS (ν_O(H) = 1 for all H, gives orbit-wise Postnikov baseline) |
| EXP-3 | For G = Z/p: interpolation between complete and trivial | ✅ PASS (exactly 2 transfer systems, ν_O interpolates correctly) |

## G1 Background

**Status**: ✅ Complete (upgraded from BLOCKED via definition-only escalation).

### Critical external dependencies (RESOLVED)

| Reference | Status | Need | Blocking? | Resolution |
|-----------|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| Blumberg-Hill (2015), arXiv:1309.1750 | ✅ RESOLVED | N∞ operad def, indexing system def, admissible set def, classification | NO | CITE_ONLY ingest: Def 3.7, 3.22, 4.3, Thm 3.24 |
| Rubin (2019), arXiv:1903.08723 | ✅ RESOLVED | Transfer system def, Ind↔Tr equivalence | NO | CITE_ONLY ingest: Def 2.1, 3.4, Thm 3.7, Cor 3.9 |

### Known facts (resolved from primary sources)

1. **N∞ operad** (BH Def 3.7): G-operad with G-contractible O_0, free Σ_n actions, and universal spaces for families F_n(O).
2. **Indexing system** (BH Def 3.22, Rubin Def 2.1): Collection of finite G-sets closed under 7 operations.
3. **Transfer system** (Rubin Def 3.4): Partial order on Sub(G) refining inclusion, closed under conjugation and restriction.
4. **Equivalence** (Rubin Thm 3.7): Indexing systems ↔ transfer systems, inverse order isomorphisms.
5. **Slice connectivity** (HY Def 1.1): τ_{≥n} generated by G_+ ∧_H S^{kρ_H} with k|H| ≥ n.
6. **Geometric FP characterization** (HY Thm 2.5): E ∈ τ_{≥n} iff Φ^H(E) is ⌈n/|H|⌉-connective for all H ≤ G.
7. **Dimension function** (HY Def 2.6): ν̄_n(G/H) = ⌈n/|H|⌉.

## G2 Route Map

**Status**: ✅ Two candidates formulated and calibrated.

### Route A (PREFERRED): O-cells with all admissible inductions

**Definition**: τ_{≥n}^O generated by {G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ind_K^H(1)} : K ≤_O H, k·|H:K| ≥ n}.

**Characterization**: E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O iff Φ^H(E) is ⌈n/ν_O(H)⌉-connective for all H ≤ G, where ν_O(H) = max{|H:K| : K ≤_O H}.

- Choice-free: YES
- Calibration (complete): PASS
- Calibration (trivial): PASS
- Calibration (Z/p): PASS

**Bottleneck theorem**: Need orbit-counting argument for "only if" and equivariant Whitehead argument for "if".

**Fail condition**: If the localizing subcategory τ_{≥n}^O doesn't yield a well-behaved filtration (i.e., slices don't exist or the tower doesn't converge).

### Route B: O-regular representation (single canonical rep per orbit)

**Definition**: τ_{≥n}^O generated by {G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ρ_H^O} : H ≤ G, k·ν_O(H) ≥ n}, where ρ_H^O = ind_{K_min}^H(1) for a minimal O-transferable subgroup K_min.

**Same characterization** as Route A.

**Fail condition**: Multiple incomparable O-minimal subgroups → non-canonical choice → Route B is not well-defined.

### Route C: Direct Z/p computation (most tractable for partial proof)

Compute explicitly for G = Z/p with complete and trivial systems, verify the characterization matches, then generalize by induction on the subgroup lattice.

## Decision: 🟡 CANDIDATE (upgraded from ❌ PARKED)

**Rationale**:
- All 8+ external definition dependencies resolved via CITE_ONLY ingest.
- Two concrete candidate definitions formulated.
- Both pass calibration tests at complete, trivial, and Z/p transfer systems.
- Characterization statement is explicit and testable.
- Proof gaps identified but bounded: orbit-counting + equivariant Whitehead.
- The ν_O dimension function construction is novel and well-motivated.

**Remaining blockers for ✅**:
1. Complete proof of characterization (both directions).
2. Verify A and B generate the same localizing subcategory.
3. Establish filtration properties (existence of slices, convergence).

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 7)

**Status**: OBSTRUCTION FOUND — characterization as stated is incorrect for intermediate transfer systems.

### Z/p^2 counterexample

For $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^2$ and transfer system $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{1 \leq_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbb{Z}/p\}$:
- $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$ (no proper transfer into $\mathbb{Z}/p^2$)
- Generator $G_+ \wedge_{\mathbb{Z}/p} S^{k\rho}$ with $k \cdot p \geq n$ has $\Phi^{\mathbb{Z}/p^2}$ connectivity $k \geq \lceil n/p \rceil$
- Characterization demands connectivity $n$ (since $\nu_{\mathcal{O}_2}(\mathbb{Z}/p^2) = 1$)
- For $p \geq 2$, $n > 1$: $\lceil n/p \rceil < n$. **FAILS.**

### Implications

1. Candidate A's generator set is too permissive for intermediate transfer systems
2. The $\nu_{\mathcal{O}}$ dimension function doesn't account for cross-level fixed-point dimension drops
3. The characterization IS correct for: $G = \mathbb{Z}/p$ (2 subgroups only), complete system (any $G$), trivial system (any $G$)
4. A modified definition or characterization is needed for the general case

### Verdict (Session 7)

P05 remains 🟡 Candidate. The counterexample is valuable: it identifies the precise obstruction to the general characterization. The definitions and calibrations are correct for the extreme cases (complete/trivial). A correct general characterization would require an "effective O-dimension function" that propagates fixed-point constraints across the subgroup lattice.

## G5 Continuation (Mode S, Session 8): Formal Theorems

**Status**: SUCCESS — three theorems proved, positive scope established.

### Results

1. **Theorem 1 (Obstruction)**: Formal proof that the characterization fails for intermediate transfer systems on groups with a chain 1 < K < H < G where K ≤_O H but H ≤_O G fails. Concrete instance: Z/p² with O = {1 ≤_O Z/p}. The "only if" direction gives connectivity ⌈n/p⌉ but demands n. Proof via double coset formula + fixed-point dimension count.

2. **Theorem 2 (Complete/Trivial)**: The characterization holds for complete (reduces to HY Thm 2.5) and trivial (reduces to orbit-wise Postnikov) transfer systems on any G. Proof: for complete, generator sets coincide; for trivial, ν_O(H) = 1 gives orbit-wise Postnikov which is standard.

3. **Theorem 3 (Z/p)**: The characterization holds for ALL transfer systems on Z/p. Proof: Z/p has exactly 2 subgroups, hence exactly 2 transfer systems (complete and trivial), both covered by Theorem 2. No intermediate transfer system exists.

### Corrected general characterization (conjecture)

Proposed effective dimension function ν_O^eff(L) = min_{(H,K): K ≤_O H, L ≤_G H} |H:K|/|(H/K)^L| that accounts for cross-level fixed-point drops. Unproved.

### Verdict

P05 upgraded within 🟡: obstruction + positive scope proved. The answer now contains 3 formal theorems with complete proofs. The general characterization remains conjectured. This is the maximum achievable without the corrected dimension function proof.

## G5 Continuation (Mode S, Session 10): "If" Direction Analysis

**Status**: BLOCKED — three approaches attempted, all obstructed. No counterexample found.

### Proof attempts

1. **Equivariant Whitehead theorem**: BLOCKED. Requires τ_{≥n}^O to be left half of a t-structure on Sp^G. The standard t-structure property relies on regular representations (ρ_H restricts to multiples of ρ_K); O-cells use ind_K^H(1) which lack this compatibility. Whether τ_{≥n}^O forms a t-structure is unproved.

2. **Orbit filtration / Postnikov tower**: BLOCKED. ν_O^eff(L) mixes contributions from all levels (e.g., for Z/p^2 with O = {1 ≤_O Z/p}: ν_O^eff(Z/p^2) = p comes from the (Z/p, 1) pair, not from the Z/p^2 level). This cross-level mixing prevents clean separation of the inductive steps in a Postnikov construction.

3. **Geometric fixed-point detection**: BLOCKED. Building an O-cell approximation ẼE with matching Φ^L is circular. The alternative (characterize (τ_{≥n}^O)^⊥ via geometric fixed-point truncation) requires RO(G)-graded homotopy for non-regular representation spheres, going beyond Hill-Yarnall.

### Counterexample search (G = Z/p^2, O = {1 ≤_O Z/p})

Computed ν_O^eff(L) = p for all L ≤ Z/p^2 in this case. Tested:
- Standard cell G_+ ∧_{Z/p^2} S^{ρ_{Z/p^2}}: doesn't satisfy connectivity conditions.
- Representation spheres S^{pσ} with σ trivial on Z/p: Φ^{Z/p^2}-connectivity too low.
- Suspended orbits: are O-cells by construction.

No counterexample found. Non-membership in a localizing subcategory is inherently hard to certify.

### Assessment

The "if" direction is a **genuinely new technical result**. It does not follow from Hill-Yarnall, Blumberg-Hill, Rubin, or HHR norm machinery. The structural gap is:
- The O-cell generators involve non-regular representation spheres S^{ind_K^H(1)}.
- All standard equivariant tools (t-structures, Whitehead theorems, Postnikov towers) are calibrated for regular representation spheres.
- Bridging this gap requires either (a) a t-structure theorem for O-cells, (b) an RO(G)-graded Whitehead for non-regular reps, or (c) a novel inductive scheme handling cross-level mixing.

### Verdict

P05 remains 🟡 Candidate. The "if" direction is now precisely characterized as a genuinely new technical result. The sharp boundary: "only if" PROVED for all G and all O; "if" PROVED for {O_max, O_min} on any G and for any O on Z/p; "if" OPEN for intermediate O on |G| ≥ p^2.

## G5 Continuation (Mode S, Session 11): Norm/Restriction Approach + Impossibility Frontier

**Status**: BLOCKED (4th approach) + FORMALIZED (frontier classification).

### Approach 4: Norm/restriction adjunction in the incomplete setting

Attempted to use the HHR norm functor N_K^H for O-admissible pairs to reduce the "if" direction to a computation in K-spectra via the norm adjunction [N_K^H(X), E]^H = [X, i_K^* E]^K.

**Two independent obstructions identified**:

1. **Multiplicative structure required**: The norm adjunction [N_K^H(X), E] = [X, i_K^* E] holds only when E is an O-algebra (commutative N_infty-algebra for the relevant operad). The problem concerns arbitrary G-spectra with no multiplicative assumption.

2. **Non-uniform isotropy separation**: Bypassing the norm adjunction and using only the Wirthmüller isomorphism, the isotropy separation sequence in RO(G)-grading kV (with V = ind_K^H(1)) has connecting maps that shift by dim(V^L) = |(H/K)^L| at subgroup L. This varies non-uniformly with L (unlike ρ_H where the shift is |H|/|L|, uniform modulo |L|). The non-uniformity prevents a clean inductive argument on the subgroup lattice.

**Verdict**: BLOCKED. Reduces to the same core obstruction as Approaches 1-3: non-uniform fixed-point dimensions of non-regular permutation representations.

### Impossibility Frontier Theorem (Theorem 5)

Formalized the complete classification of all (G, O) pairs into:
- **Class I** (biconditional PROVED): O extremal (O_max or O_min on any G) or |Sub(G)| = 2 (any O on Z/p).
- **Class II** ("only if" PROVED, "if" OPEN): O intermediate on |Sub(G)| >= 3. Smallest open case: Z/p^2 with O = {1 ≤_O Z/p}.

Includes:
- Complete classification table by group type and transfer system type
- Explicit class map: Z/p (all proved), Z/p^2 (1 open), Z/p × Z/p (>= p-1 open), S_3 (>= 2 open), etc.
- Three structural gaps (t-structure, non-uniform fixed-point dimensions, RO(G)-graded connectivity transfer) that any proof must address
- Proof that all four approaches reduce to the same root cause: non-uniform dim(V^L) for V = ind_K^H(1)

### Verdict

P05 remains 🟡 Candidate. No new theorems proved (the 4 from Sessions 8-9 stand). The contribution of Session 11 is: (1) exhaustion of the norm/restriction approach as a 4th independent attack, and (2) formal classification of the impossibility frontier, converting the informal "we tried and failed" into a precise mathematical statement (Theorem 5) about which cases are proved and which structural properties any future proof must establish.

## G5 Continuation (Mode S, Session 12): R2 Exhaustive Computation + Restricted Sufficiency

**Status**: SUCCESS -- two new theorems (Thms 6-7); "if" direction proved for Class Ia.

### Computational methodology

Python script `P05/experiments/exp1_transfer_systems.py` exhaustively enumerates:
- All subgroups and transfer systems on 17 groups of order <= 12
- Fixed-point dimension tables for every admissible pair (using orbits, not fixed points)
- Dimension-uniformity classification for all 793 intermediate transfer systems

### Key correction: orbits vs fixed points

The original analysis (Sessions 10-11) implicitly used the wrong quantity for representation-theoretic fixed-point dimension. For a permutation representation V = C[H/K]:
- dim(V^L) = #(L-orbits on H/K), NOT #(L-fixed-points on H/K)
- For the regular representation: dim(rho_H^L) = |H|/|L| (orbits)

This correction does NOT affect Theorems 1-5 (which use the correct double coset formula for geometric fixed points of G-spectra), but it changes the dimension-uniformity analysis.

### Results

**Theorem 6 (Characterization of dimension-uniform systems)**: An intermediate transfer system O is dimension-uniform iff every non-reflexive admissible pair (K, H) has K = 1 (trivial subgroup). Proved analytically and verified on all 793 intermediate systems.

**Theorem 7 (Restricted sufficiency for regular-only systems)**: For dimension-uniform ("regular-only") transfer systems, the full biconditional characterization holds. The "if" direction reduces to the standard Hill-Yarnall argument with a restricted generator set of regular representation cells.

**Data**: 104/793 intermediate systems (13.1%) are dimension-uniform (Class Ia). The remaining 689 (Class II) all have non-trivial K in some pair and exhibit non-uniform fixed-point dimensions.

### Impact on frontier

The "smallest open case" from Session 11 (Z/p^2 with O = {1 <=_O Z/p}) is now PROVED (it falls in Class Ia). The true smallest open case is Z/4 with O = {Z/2 <=_O Z/4} (Class II).

### Verdict

P05 strengthened within Candidate. Two new theorems proved (Thms 6-7). The open frontier is now restricted to Class II systems only. No upgrade to Green because Class II remains genuinely open, but the proved scope has been materially expanded.

**Step 1 (Integer-graded control).** From the connectivity hypotheses (Φ^1, Φ^{Z/2} are n-connective; Φ^{Z/4} is ⌈n/2⌉-connective), the isotropy separation sequences yield: π_j^1(E) = 0 for j < n; π_j^{Z/2}(E) = 0 for j < n (since χ|_{Z/2} = trivial, so (E^1)_{hZ/2} is n-connective); π_j^{Z/4}(E) = 0 for j < ⌈n/2⌉.

**Step 2 (Isotropy decomposition).** The cofibration EP_{Z/4,+} ∧ E → E → ẼP_{Z/4} ∧ E decomposes E into a "proper subgroup part" and a "Z/4-local part."

- **Proper part**: EP_{Z/4,+} ∧ E is supported on Z/4/Z/2 and Z/4/1 orbits. Φ^1 and Φ^{Z/2} are n-connective, Φ^{Z/4} vanishes. By Theorem 2(b), this is in τ_{≥n}^{O_min} ⊆ τ_{≥n}^O. ✓
- **Z/4-local part**: ẼP_{Z/4} ∧ E has Φ^{Z/4}-connectivity ⌈n/2⌉.
- By extension closure: E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O **iff** ẼP_{Z/4} ∧ E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O.

**Step 3 (Reduction to localized t-structure).** The Z/4-local generators of τ_{≥n}^O are {S^{kV} ∧ ẼP_{Z/4} : k ≥ ⌈n/2⌉}. Since V^{Z/4} = 1, these have Z/4-connectivity exactly k. The question becomes: for X = ẼP_{Z/4} ∧ E supported at the Z/4-orbit, does Φ^{Z/4}(X) being m-connective imply X ∈ Loc(S^{kV} ∧ ẼP_{Z/4} : k ≥ m)?

**Step 4 (Obstruction).** For V = ρ_{Z/4} (regular rep), this is exactly the Hill-Yarnall t-structure theorem. For V = 1 ⊕ χ (non-regular), the localized spheres S^{kV} ∧ ẼP_{Z/4} have a different RO(G)-graded cell structure: ρ_{Z/4} = V ⊕ (σ ⊕ σ³), so S^{kρ} = S^{kV} ∧ S^{k(σ⊕σ³)}. The O-cells "miss" the σ ⊕ σ³ part, meaning the localized t-structure must be proved with strictly fewer cells. No technique available to do this.

**Verdict**: CONFIRMED IRREDUCIBLE. Even for the smallest open case, the "if" direction reduces (via isotropy separation Steps 1-3) to Gap 1 restricted to Z/4-local spectra: a t-structure theorem for non-regular representation spheres. The isotropy separation successfully isolates the problem to a single localized question but cannot resolve it. No counterexample found; no new bridge lemma obtained.

**Delta from prior state**: New approach (5th) attempted. Achieves clean reduction to Z/4-local t-structure but cannot close. Confirms Gap 1 is the irreducible core even at the minimal case level. Status unchanged.

## Candidate-G6 Review (Closeout Cycle 4, 2026-02-12)

**Scope**: Editorial audit of final 🟡 Candidate package. No new math claims.

### Checklist

| # | Item | Verdict | Notes |
|---|------|---------|-------|
| C1 | Proved/cited/empirical separation | **PASS** | Evidence taxonomy (§9) cleanly separates 6 tiers: Proved (Thms 1-4, 6-7), Defined (ν_O, τ_{≥n}^O, ν_O^eff), Computed (825 TS on 17 groups), Stated (biconditional with ⇒ proved / ⇐ partially proved), Calibrated (extreme cases + Z/p + Class Ia), Conjectured ("if" for Class II only). Thm 5 correctly classified as a classification/frontier statement. No tier bleed. |
| C2 | No unresolved claim labeled solved | **PASS** | Status is 🟡 Candidate, NOT ✅. §6.2: "if" direction explicitly labeled "Conjecture." §7.3: "What is NOT proved" section present. §7.4 Thm 5 gives complete classification with Class II "OPEN." §8.6 refined frontier correctly marks Class II as open. Smallest open case updated to Z/4 with O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4} (Session 12 correction). |
| C3 | Statement-level citation hygiene | **PASS** | All 3 external sources (Blumberg-Hill, Rubin, Hill-Yarnall) at CITE_ONLY level — web-fetched from ar5iv. Used for definitions (§2.1-2.7) and one theorem reduction (Thm 2(a) → HY Thm 2.5). All inline proofs (Thms 1, 4, 6, 7) are self-contained, using only standard equivariant homotopy theory. No citation is used beyond its verified scope. |
| C4 | Blocker is single-sentence explicit | **PASS** | §7.4 conclusion: "The common structural root of all four blocked proof approaches is the non-uniform fixed-point dimension of non-regular permutation representations across the subgroup lattice." Single sentence identifying root cause. 3 specific gaps enumerated. |

### Minor observations (not faults)

1. **Thm 7 proof exposition**: The proof sketch (§8.5) contains a self-correction ("wait, this inclusion goes the WRONG way") followed by a corrected argument. The corrected logic is sound (reduction to HY at S-levels with regular rep cells), but the inline self-correction is stylistically unusual for a proof document. Does not affect correctness.
2. **Theorem count**: Header says "6 theorems proved" but 7 theorem statements exist (Thms 1-7). The audit reconciles this by excluding Thm 5 as "a classification." Internally consistent but could be clearer.

### Verdict

**ACCEPT (0 faults, 2 minor observations).** P05 package is clean. The 7-theorem structure with proved/open classification is rigorous. Citation hygiene is strong (all CITE_ONLY properly sourced). The Class I / Ia / II frontier is precisely delineated with explicit structural gaps.

## Session 14 — Closeout Cycle 6 (2026-02-12)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Cycle ID | Closeout Cycle 6 |
| Date | 2026-02-12 |
| Objective | Final assessment of Class II gap; determine if any 6th approach exists |
| Message cap | 8 |
| Token estimate | ~2K |

### Assessment

The Class II "if" direction has been attacked from 5 independent angles, all reducing to the same core obstruction: non-uniform dim(V^L) for V = ind_K^H(1) when K ≠ 1. This is an irreducible gap at current tooling level:

1. **Equivariant Whitehead** — reduces to t-structure for non-regular cells
2. **Orbit filtration** — non-uniform fibers block inductive step
3. **Geometric fixed-point detection** — non-uniform representation cells not covered by standard HY
4. **Norm/restriction adjunction** — counit map analysis blocked by same non-uniformity
5. **Isotropy separation (Session 13)** — reduces to localized t-structure for Z/4-local spectra; still blocked

No 6th approach identified. The gap requires either (a) a new representation-theoretic tool for non-regular permutation modules, or (b) an equivariant homotopy technique that bypasses dimension-uniformity (e.g., direct construction of a t-structure on the O-complete stable category using non-traditional generators). Neither is within sprint scope.

**Verdict**: HOLD at 🟡 Candidate. 7 theorems + Frontier Theorem. L5 barrier confirmed.
