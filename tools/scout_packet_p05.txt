FAILURE-CONDITIONED SCOUT PROMPT — P05 (Equivariant Homotopy Theory)
====================================================================

## Exact Target Claim

Let G be a finite group and O an incomplete transfer system (partial order on Sub(G) refining inclusion, closed under conjugation and restriction). Define:
- ν_O^eff(L) = max over (H,K) with K ≤_O H and L ≤ H of |H:K| / |(H/K)^L|
- τ_{≥n}^O = localizing subcategory of G-spectra generated by {G_+ ∧_H S^{k·ind_K^H(1)} : K ≤_O H, k·|H:K| ≥ n}

Conjecture ("if" direction): If E is a connective G-spectrum with Φ^L(E) is ⌈n/ν_O^eff(L)⌉-connective for all L ≤ G, then E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O.

## Proved Scope

7 theorems proved:
- Thm 1: Obstruction — characterization fails for intermediate O on Z/p² with the naive ν_O (not ν_O^eff). Corrected version uses ν_O^eff.
- Thm 2: Biconditional holds for complete (O = O_max) and trivial (O = O_min) transfer systems on any G.
- Thm 3: Biconditional holds for all O on Z/p (only 2 transfer systems exist, both extremal).
- Thm 4: "Only if" direction proved for ALL G and ALL O using ν_O^eff.
- Thm 5: Impossibility Frontier Classification — Class I (biconditional proved) vs Class II (only "only if" proved).
- Thm 6: An intermediate transfer system is dimension-uniform iff every non-reflexive admissible pair (K,H) has K = 1 (trivial subgroup). ("Regular-only" systems.)
- Thm 7: For dimension-uniform (Class Ia) systems, the full biconditional holds. Proof reduces to Hill-Yarnall with restricted regular-representation generators.

Exhaustive computation: 825 total transfer systems on 17 groups of order ≤ 12; 793 intermediate; 104 dimension-uniform (Class Ia, all proved by Thm 7); 689 Class II (open).

## Unresolved Blocker (single sentence)

The "if" direction for Class II transfer systems (those with at least one admissible pair (K,H) where K ≠ 1) fails because ind_K^H(1) has non-uniform fixed-point dimensions across the subgroup lattice, unlike the regular representation where dim(ρ_H^L) = |H|/|L| is uniform.

## Failed Approaches (5 total, with reason each failed)

1. **Equivariant Whitehead theorem**: Requires τ_{≥n}^O to be the left half of a t-structure on Sp^G. Standard t-structures use regular representations; O-cells use ind_K^H(1) (non-regular). Whether τ_{≥n}^O forms a t-structure is unproved and likely requires the very dimension-uniformity that fails.

2. **Orbit filtration / Postnikov tower**: ν_O^eff(L) mixes contributions from different levels of the subgroup lattice (e.g., for Z/p² with O = {1 ≤_O Z/p}: ν_O^eff(Z/p²) = p comes from the (Z/p, 1) pair, not from Z/p² level). Cross-level mixing prevents clean separation of inductive steps.

3. **Geometric fixed-point detection**: Building an O-cell approximation with matching Φ^L is circular. The alternative (characterize (τ_{≥n}^O)^⊥ via geometric FP truncation) requires RO(G)-graded homotopy for non-regular representation spheres, going beyond Hill-Yarnall.

4. **Norm/restriction adjunction**: The HHR norm adjunction [N_K^H(X), E]^H = [X, i_K^* E]^K requires E to be an O-algebra (commutative N∞-algebra). The problem concerns arbitrary G-spectra. Bypassing via Wirthmüller gives isotropy separation with non-uniform shifts dim(V^L) = |(H/K)^L| — same core obstruction.

5. **Isotropy separation for Z/4**: For the smallest open case (Z/4, O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4}, V = 1 ⊕ χ), cofibration EP_{Z/4,+} ∧ E → E → ẼP_{Z/4} ∧ E successfully reduces to Z/4-local spectra. But the Z/4-local generators involve S^{kV} (non-regular cells) where V = 1 ⊕ χ misses the σ ⊕ σ³ part of ρ_{Z/4}. The localized t-structure for non-regular cells is unproved.

## Hard Constraints

- No web searching for solutions to competition problems
- Statement-level citations only for published results
- No human mathematical input
- Smallest open case: G = Z/4, O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4}, V = ind_{Z/2}^{Z/4}(1) = 1 ⊕ χ

## What Counts as Success

ONE of:
(a) A proof of the "if" direction for the smallest open case Z/4 with O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4}
(b) A counterexample: a connective Z/4-spectrum satisfying the geometric FP connectivity bounds but NOT in τ_{≥n}^O
(c) A citation to a published result about t-structures for non-regular representation spheres
(d) A new structural theorem that handles non-uniform fixed-point dimensions
(e) A reduction showing the problem is equivalent to a known open problem in equivariant stable homotopy theory
