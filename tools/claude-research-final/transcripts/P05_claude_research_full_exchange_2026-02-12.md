# Claude Research Full Exchange — P05

Date captured: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided Claude research transcript + response (manual paste)  
Lane: P05  
Purpose: Preserve process trace and research conclusions for escalation audit.

## 1) Main response artifact

Primary response is archived verbatim at:
- `tools/claude-research-final/transcripts/P05_claude_research_response_2026-02-12.md`

Top-line outcomes:
1. Class II “if” direction remains open.
2. No counterexample found in the surveyed sources.
3. Suggested structural route: Carrick framing + Smith reconstruction + Schwede–Shipley reduction.

## 2) Process trace summary (as provided)

The provided trace indicates:
1. local packet ingestion (`problem_context`, `experiments_bundle`, `lane_packet`),
2. blocker synthesis around non-uniform fixed-point dimensions,
3. broad source expansion (“604 sources” in reported run),
4. synthesis into a ranked strategic report with contamination-risk labels.

## 3) Escalation/contamination interpretation

Because this run is broad-research escalation:
1. Treat all imported statements as provisional until primary-source checked.
2. Log each adopted statement with:
   - source,
   - UTC access time,
   - exact extracted claim,
   - contamination risk,
   - integrate/quarantine decision.
3. Keep P05 status unchanged unless a checkable theorem-level bridge lemma is produced.

## 4) Integration status

- This transcript is archival/supporting context.
- It does not itself close P05.
- It sharpens the frontier and suggests a bounded next-cycle route map.
