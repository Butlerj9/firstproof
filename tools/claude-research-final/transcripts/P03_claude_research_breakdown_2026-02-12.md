# Claude Research Breakdown — P03

Date: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided Claude research transcript/response  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Distill actionable next steps from the 14-route proposal.

---

## 1) High-value signal

### Newly emphasized route cluster
1. **Signed multiline queue q=1 symmetry proof** (Approach 1).
2. **Interpolation PushTASEP reversibility bridge** (Approach 3, contingent on forthcoming `[BDW]` details).
3. **Symmetric-subspace vanishing dimension count** (Approach 10).

### Why this is nontrivial
- These target the exact unresolved object: lower-degree correction terms of interpolation polynomials at `q=1`.
- They are not the same as previous brute-force n=5 expansion attempts or prior branching failures.

---

## 2) Evidence-tier extraction

### Proved (in current lane context, unchanged)
- n=2,3,4 verified/proved (existing lane result).
- n>=5 remains open with documented L5 barrier.

### Cited (from this new response, needs verification before use)
- Ben Dali–Williams signed multiline queue formula (2025 preprint).
- Ayyer–Martin–Williams t-PushTASEP framework (2024).
- Kasatani–Takeyama rational KZ connection (2008).
- Sahi nonsymmetric binomial theorem (1998).

### Empirical/proposed
- 14 candidate families with viability ranking.
- Tiering suggests combinatorial + symmetric-subspace linear algebra as fastest testable branch.

### Unresolved
- No theorem-level bridge lemma is completed in the response.
- `[BDW]` interpolation probabilistic analogue is referenced as forthcoming, so this route is presently dependency-constrained.

## 3) Novelty gate vs previously killed routes

### Strong novelty (good candidates)
1. Signed multiline queue interpolation formula (new object-level formula).
2. PushTASEP detailed-balance route (cross-domain probabilistic invariant).
3. KZ monodromy route (analytic representation rather than direct Hecke degeneration).
4. Symmetric-subspace dimension-counting route (refined version of spectral-collapse logic).

### Medium novelty / high dependency
1. Elliptic degeneration.
2. Nonsymmetric plethysm extension.
3. Jordan/Capelli character route.

### Lower immediate ROI
1. Routes relying on forthcoming unpublished details before explicit formulas are available.
2. Routes requiring large new frameworks without an early falsifiable test.

---

## 4) Recommended bounded follow-up cycle (P03)

### Primary (fastest executable)
1. **Approach 10 pilot**:
   - computationally compute collapsed spectral constraints at `q=1` for `n=5`,
   - evaluate dimension of symmetric vanishing subspace,
   - determine whether dim=1 holds in tested slices.
2. **Approach 1 pilot**:
   - extract exact signed multiline queue weight formula at `q=1`,
   - test transposition invariance numerically/combinatorially on small anti-dominant shapes.

### Secondary
3. **Approach 5 pilot**:
   - map the target interpolation object into the rational KZ solution space,
   - run a minimal monodromy-type check in smallest nontrivial case.

### Stop-loss
- If no bridge lemma candidate survives after one bounded cycle, keep `P03` at candidate with updated frontier language only.

## 5) Contamination and integration guidance

Before adopting any statement from this response:
1. Add contamination/source entries for each new external theorem source.
2. Separate published, verifiable claims from forthcoming/dependency claims.
3. Keep main status unchanged until a lane-local derivation or checkable proof artifact exists.
