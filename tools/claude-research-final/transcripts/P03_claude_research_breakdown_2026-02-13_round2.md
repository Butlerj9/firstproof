# Claude Research Breakdown — P03 (Round 2)

Date: 2026-02-13  
Source: User-provided "P03 Frontier Certificate v2" response  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: distill execution signal for immediate Claude Code follow-up.

## 1) High-value signal

1. Hard gate confirmed:
   - static `q=1`-only arguments are insufficient (EXP-5b symmetric space dim 14).
2. Valid route requirement:
   - must model or control the `q->1` limit-selection mechanism.
3. Prioritized survivors from intake:
   - S1 Signed multiline queues (q-dependent formula, q=1 specialization),
   - S2 Signed tableaux (same family, independent model),
   - S3 PushTASEP reversibility (dependency-sensitive),
   - S4 Rational KZ monodromy,
   - S5 Binomial theorem limit,
   - S6 Yang-Baxter degeneracy,
   - S7 Elliptic degeneration.

## 2) Immediate bounded execution order implied

1. Start with S1/S2 computational pilots on small cases.
2. Keep S3 as dependency-gated (forthcoming source risk).
3. Stage S4/S5/S6 as bridge-lemma tests if S1/S2 do not close.
4. Treat S7 as long-horizon backup.

---

## 3) Stop-loss from this intake

1. If a route does not explicitly touch limit-selection, kill it.
2. No claims from static `q=1` dimension-counting uniqueness.
3. No status upgrade without a checkable lemma/proof artifact.

---

## 4) Recommended next checklist delta

Add to next P03 Claude Code checklist:
1. Route-level limit-selection compliance check.
2. S1/S2 first-3-script pilot block.
3. Explicit kill criterion for any static q=1-only argument.
