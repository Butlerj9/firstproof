### Reviewer red flags (G6)
1. **Core proof gap**: General-$n$ theorem rests on a finite De Bruijn identity that is not established.
2. **Overclaim corrected**: Original draft said "YES for all $n$"; revised to separate proved ($n=2$) from conjectured ($n \geq 3$).
3. **Asymptotic-to-finite**: Voiculescu (1998) is motivation/analogy only, not a proof of the finite-$n$ claim.
4. **Experiment precision**: `np.roots` projects complex outputs to real parts; mpmath confirmation covers key cases but not all.

## Problem statement

*(Verbatim from arXiv:2602.05192v1, Question 4)*

Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be two monic polynomials of degree $n$:
$$p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^{n-k}, \quad q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k x^{n-k}$$
where $a_0 = b_0 = 1$. Define $p \boxplus_n q$ by
$$(p \boxplus_n q)(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k x^{n-k}, \quad c_k = \sum_{i+j=k} \frac{(n-i)!\,(n-j)!}{n!\,(n-k)!}\, a_i b_j.$$
For a monic polynomial $p(x) = \prod_{i \leq n}(x - \lambda_i)$, define
$$\Phi_n(p) := \sum_{i \leq n} \left(\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}\right)^{\!2}$$
and $\Phi_n(p) := \infty$ if $p$ has a multiple root. **Is it true that**
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \;\geq\; \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}\;?$$

## Answer: YES ($n=2$ proved; $n=3$ proved; $n \geq 4$ conjectured, open)

> **Note (reconciliation, 2026-02-11):** CE-7 confirms that $\boxplus_4$ for centered quartics has a cross-term $c_4 = a_4 + b_4 + \tfrac{1}{6}a_2 b_2$, which breaks the clean coefficient additivity exploited in the $n=3$ proof. No alternative proof route for $n \geq 4$ is known. Status downgraded from ✅ to 🟡.

### 1. Preliminaries and notation

**Convention.** We use the descending-power convention: $p(x) = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n$ with $a_0 = 1$ (monic). The $k$-th coefficient $a_k$ multiplies $x^{n-k}$. Vieta's formulas give $a_1 = -\sum \lambda_i$, $a_2 = \sum_{i<j}\lambda_i \lambda_j$, etc.

**Equivalent form of $\Phi_n$.** By logarithmic differentiation, if $p(\lambda_i) = 0$ and $p'(\lambda_i) \neq 0$:
$$\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} = \frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)}.$$
Therefore $\Phi_n(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)}\right)^{\!2}$.

**Critical dependency.** By Marcus–Spielman–Srivastava (2015, "Interlacing Families II," arXiv:1507.05506), if $p, q$ are monic real-rooted of degree $n$, then $p \boxplus_n q$ is also monic real-rooted of degree $n$. This guarantees $\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)$ is well-defined.

### 2. Case analysis for multiple roots

Let $h = p \boxplus_n q$. With the convention $1/\infty = 0$:

**Case 1** (both $p, q$ have multiple roots): RHS $= 0$, LHS $\geq 0$. Trivially holds.

**Case 2** (exactly one has a multiple root, say $p$): Inequality reduces to $1/\Phi_n(h) \geq 1/\Phi_n(q)$. This is a non-trivial claim addressed by the general proof.

**Case 3** (both simple-rooted, $h$ simple-rooted): The main case. All quantities are finite and positive.

**Case 3a** (both simple-rooted, $h$ has a multiple root): Then LHS $= 0$ while RHS $> 0$, so the inequality *fails*. Our experiments confirm this case does not occur: $\boxplus_n$ preserves simplicity of roots in all 285,000+ tested cases.

**In what follows, we assume all three polynomials have simple roots** (the generic case).

### 3. K-transform framework

**Definition.** The *K-transform* of a monic degree-$n$ polynomial $p$ is:
$$K_p(z) = z - n \cdot \frac{p(z)}{p'(z)}.$$

**Key properties** (MSS 2015):
1. **Additivity under $\boxplus_n$:** $K_{p \boxplus_n q}(z) = K_p(z) + K_q(z) - z$.
2. At a root $\lambda_i$ of $p$: $K_p(\lambda_i) = \lambda_i$ (trivially, since $p(\lambda_i) = 0$).
3. $K_p'(\lambda_i) = 1 - n$.

**Connection to $\Phi_n$.** Define $F(z) = p(z)/p'(z)$. At a root $\lambda_i$:
- $F(\lambda_i) = 0$, $F'(\lambda_i) = 1$,
- $F''(\lambda_i) = -p''(\lambda_i)/p'(\lambda_i)$.

Since $K_p(z) = z - nF(z)$, we get $K_p''(\lambda_i) = -nF''(\lambda_i) = n \cdot p''(\lambda_i)/p'(\lambda_i)$.

Therefore:
$$\frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)} = \frac{K_p''(\lambda_i)}{2n}$$

and

$$\boxed{\Phi_n(p) = \frac{1}{4n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigl[K_p''(\lambda_i)\bigr]^2}$$

where the sum runs over the roots $\lambda_i$ of $p$.

### 4. Proof for $n = 2$: equality

For $n = 2$: $p(x) = x^2 + a_1 x + a_2$, $q(x) = x^2 + b_1 x + b_2$.

**Convolution:**
$$c_1 = a_1 + b_1, \qquad c_2 = a_2 + b_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}a_1 b_1.$$

**Root gap squared:** For a monic quadratic $x^2 + px + q$, the root gap is $\Delta = (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2 = p^2 - 4q$, and $\Phi_2 = 2/\Delta$, so $1/\Phi_2 = \Delta/2$.

Compute:
$$\Delta_h = c_1^2 - 4c_2 = (a_1 + b_1)^2 - 4(a_2 + b_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}a_1 b_1)$$
$$= a_1^2 + 2a_1 b_1 + b_1^2 - 4a_2 - 4b_2 - 2a_1 b_1 = (a_1^2 - 4a_2) + (b_1^2 - 4b_2) = \Delta_p + \Delta_q.$$

Therefore $1/\Phi_2(h) = \Delta_h/2 = \Delta_p/2 + \Delta_q/2 = 1/\Phi_2(p) + 1/\Phi_2(q)$. **Equality holds exactly for all $n = 2$.** $\square$

### 4b. Equality for $n = 3$ equally-spaced roots (NEW)

**Theorem.** Let $p$ and $q$ be monic cubics with equally-spaced roots (i.e., roots forming an arithmetic progression). Then $p \boxplus_3 q$ also has equally-spaced roots, and **equality holds**: $1/\Phi_3(h) = 1/\Phi_3(p) + 1/\Phi_3(q)$.

**Proof.** For a monic cubic with equally-spaced roots $\{a, a+d, a+2d\}$ and gap $d > 0$:

$$\Phi_3 = \sum_{i=0}^{2} \left(\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{(i-j)d}\right)^{\!2} = \frac{1}{d^2}\left[\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\!2} + 0^2 + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{\!2}\right] = \frac{9}{2d^2}$$

so $1/\Phi_3 = 2d^2/9$ depends only on the gap $d$, not the center $a$.

**Gap-squared additivity under $\boxplus_3$.** Let $p$ have gap $d_1$ and $q$ have gap $d_2$. Then $h = p \boxplus_3 q$ has equally-spaced roots with gap $g = \sqrt{d_1^2 + d_2^2}$.

*Verification*: Confirmed at 200-digit precision for all gap combinations $(d_1, d_2) \in \{(0.1, 0.1), (0.1, 0.2), (0.1, 0.3), (0.2, 0.3), (0.1, 1.0)\}$. The convolution root gaps match $\sqrt{d_1^2+d_2^2}$ to within $10^{-200}$, and the margin $1/\Phi_3(h) - 1/\Phi_3(p) - 1/\Phi_3(q)$ is $O(10^{-200})$ (exact equality).

**Consequence:**
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_3(h)} = \frac{2g^2}{9} = \frac{2(d_1^2 + d_2^2)}{9} = \frac{2d_1^2}{9} + \frac{2d_2^2}{9} = \frac{1}{\Phi_3(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_3(q)}. \quad \square$$

**Note.** For $n \geq 4$, $\boxplus_n$ does NOT preserve equal spacing (numerically verified for $n = 4, 5$), and strict inequality holds for equally-spaced inputs. The equality pattern is specific to $n \leq 3$.

**General formula.** For equally-spaced $n$-roots with gap $d$: $\Phi_n = S_n / d^2$ where $S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(H_i - H_{n-1-i})^2$ and $H_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k} 1/j$. Values: $S_2 = 2$, $S_3 = 9/2$, $S_4 = 65/9$, $S_5 \approx 4.93$.

### 4c. Proof for $n = 3$: general case (NEW)

**Theorem.** For all monic real-rooted cubics $p, q$ with simple roots:
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_3(p \boxplus_3 q)} \;\geq\; \frac{1}{\Phi_3(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_3(q)}.$$
Equality holds if and only if both $p$ and $q$ have equally-spaced roots.

**Proof.**

**Step 1 (Centering).** Since $\Phi_n$ depends only on root differences (translation-invariant), and $\boxplus_3$ preserves centering ($c_1 = a_1 + b_1$), we may assume WLOG that $p(x) = x^3 + ax + b$ and $q(x) = x^3 + cx + d$ are centered ($a_1 = b_1 = 0$).

**Step 2 (Coefficient additivity).** For centered cubics, the $\boxplus_3$ formula simplifies: $c_2 = a_2 + b_2 + \tfrac{2}{3}a_1 b_1 = a_2 + b_2$ and $c_3 = a_3 + b_3 + \tfrac{1}{3}(a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1) = a_3 + b_3$. Therefore $h := p \boxplus_3 q = x^3 + (a+c)x + (b+d)$.

**Step 3 (Closed-form for $\Phi_3$).** For $f(x) = x^3 + \alpha x + \beta$ with discriminant $\Delta = -4\alpha^3 - 27\beta^2 > 0$ (simple real roots, requiring $\alpha < 0$):

$$\Phi_3(f) = \frac{18\alpha^2}{\Delta}.$$

*Derivation.* Since $f'(\lambda_i) = 3\lambda_i^2 + \alpha$ and $f''(\lambda_i) = 6\lambda_i$:
$$\Phi_3 = \sum_{i=1}^{3} \left(\frac{3\lambda_i}{3\lambda_i^2 + \alpha}\right)^{\!2} = 9 \sum_i \frac{\lambda_i^2}{(3\lambda_i^2 + \alpha)^2}.$$

Using the algebraic identity $\frac{\lambda^2}{(3\lambda^2+\alpha)^2} = \frac{1}{3}\!\left(\frac{1}{3\lambda^2+\alpha} - \frac{\alpha}{(3\lambda^2+\alpha)^2}\right)$ and the partial-fraction identity $\sum_i 1/f'(\lambda_i) = 0$ (valid for any monic polynomial of degree $\geq 2$):

$$\sum_i \frac{\lambda_i^2}{(3\lambda_i^2 + \alpha)^2} = -\frac{\alpha}{3}\sum_i \frac{1}{f'(\lambda_i)^2}.$$

The sum $\sum_i 1/f'(\lambda_i)^2$ is computed by the residue method. Writing $g(z) = f'(z)/((3z^2+\alpha)^2 \cdot f(z)) = 1/((3z^2+\alpha) \cdot f(z))$, the sum of residues at roots of $f$ equals $\sum_i 1/f'(\lambda_i)^2$. By the residue theorem, this equals the negative of the sum of residues at the poles $z = \pm\sqrt{-\alpha/3}$ of $1/(3z^2+\alpha)$ (the residue at $\infty$ vanishes). Computing these residues yields:

$$\sum_i \frac{1}{f'(\lambda_i)^2} = \frac{6\alpha}{4\alpha^3 + 27\beta^2} = -\frac{6\alpha}{\Delta}.$$

Combining: $\Phi_3 = 9 \cdot (-\alpha/3) \cdot (-6\alpha/\Delta) = 18\alpha^2/\Delta$. $\square$

*Verification*: For $x^3 - x$ ($\alpha = -1, \beta = 0$): $\Phi_3 = 18/4 = 9/2$. ✓
For $x^3 - 7x + 6$ (roots $\{-3, 1, 2\}$): $\Phi_3 = 18 \cdot 49/(-4 \cdot (-343) - 27 \cdot 36) = 882/400 = 441/200$. ✓ (Exact match with direct computation, CE-6.)

**Step 4 (Reduction to elementary inequality).** Since $1/\Phi_3(f) = \Delta/(18\alpha^2) = -4\alpha/18 - 27\beta^2/(18\alpha^2)$, the inequality becomes:

$$-\frac{4(a+c)}{18} - \frac{27(b+d)^2}{18(a+c)^2} \;\geq\; -\frac{4a}{18} - \frac{27b^2}{18a^2} - \frac{4c}{18} - \frac{27d^2}{18c^2}.$$

The linear terms $-4\alpha/18$ are additive and cancel, leaving:

$$\left(\frac{b+d}{a+c}\right)^{\!2} \;\leq\; \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{\!2} + \left(\frac{d}{c}\right)^{\!2}. \qquad (\star)$$

**Step 5 (Jensen's inequality).** Define weights $w_1 = a/(a+c)$ and $w_2 = c/(a+c)$. Since $a, c < 0$ (required for real roots) and $a + c < 0$, both $w_1, w_2 > 0$ with $w_1 + w_2 = 1$. Setting $u = b/a$ and $v = d/c$:

$$\frac{b+d}{a+c} = \frac{ua + vc}{a+c} = w_1 u + w_2 v.$$

Since $x \mapsto x^2$ is strictly convex, Jensen's inequality gives:

$$(w_1 u + w_2 v)^2 \;\leq\; w_1 u^2 + w_2 v^2 \qquad \text{(i)}$$

with equality iff $u = v$. Furthermore, since $0 < w_i < 1$:

$$w_1 u^2 + w_2 v^2 \;\leq\; u^2 + v^2 \qquad \text{(ii)}$$

since $u^2 + v^2 - w_1 u^2 - w_2 v^2 = w_2 u^2 + w_1 v^2 \geq 0$.

Combining (i) and (ii) proves $(\star)$. $\square$

**Step 6 (Multiple-root cases).** If $p$ has a multiple root ($\Delta_p = 0$), then $1/\Phi_3(p) = 0$ and the inequality reduces to $1/\Phi_3(h) \geq 1/\Phi_3(q)$. The same proof applies: the key inequality $(\star)$ still holds, and the $\Delta_p/a^2 = 0$ term simply drops out. Discriminant preservation: when $\Delta_p \geq 0$ and $\Delta_q > 0$, one verifies $\Delta_h > 0$ via the bound $(|a|^{3/2} + |c|^{3/2})^2 \leq (|a| + |c|)^3$ (which follows from convexity of $x^{3/2}$ on $[0,\infty)$), ensuring $h$ has simple roots.

**Step 7 (Equality characterization).** Equality in $(\star)$ requires equality in both (i) and (ii). Equality in (i) requires $u = v$, i.e., $b/a = d/c$. Equality in (ii) requires $w_2 u^2 + w_1 v^2 = 0$, which (given $w_1, w_2 > 0$) forces $u = v = 0$, i.e., $b = d = 0$. This is the equally-spaced case of §4b.

*Numerical verification*: CE-6 verifies the closed-form formula exactly for 5 cubic families, the key inequality for 100,000 random pairs, and the full $\Phi_3$ inequality exactly (rational arithmetic) for 20 random integer-root cubic pairs. All pass. $\square$

### 5. Structure theorem: K-transform decomposition at roots of the convolution

Let $h = p \boxplus_n q$ with roots $\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_n$. By K-transform additivity:
$$K_h''(z) = K_p''(z) + K_q''(z)$$
for all $z$ in the domain. At each root $\nu_k$ of $h$:
$$\frac{h''(\nu_k)}{2\,h'(\nu_k)} = \frac{K_h''(\nu_k)}{2n} = \frac{K_p''(\nu_k) + K_q''(\nu_k)}{2n}.$$

Define $u_k := K_p''(\nu_k)/(2n)$ and $v_k := K_q''(\nu_k)/(2n)$. Then:

$$\Phi_n(h) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (u_k + v_k)^2 = \|u\|^2 + 2\langle u, v\rangle + \|v\|^2$$

where $\|u\|^2 = \sum_k u_k^2$, $\|v\|^2 = \sum_k v_k^2$, and $\langle u, v \rangle = \sum_k u_k v_k$.

The key subtlety: $\|u\|^2 = (1/4n^2)\sum_k [K_p''(\nu_k)]^2$ evaluates $K_p''$ at the roots of $h$ (not of $p$), so $\|u\|^2 \neq \Phi_n(p)$ in general.

### 6. Proof sketch for general $n$ (connection to free Fisher information)

The quantity $\Phi_n(p)$ is the **finite free Fisher information** of the empirical root measure $\mu_p = (1/n)\sum_i \delta_{\lambda_i}$. The inequality
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \geq \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}$$
is the finite analog of **Voiculescu's free Fisher information inequality** (1998), which states that for compactly supported probability measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}$:
$$\frac{1}{\Phi^*(\mu \boxplus \nu)} \geq \frac{1}{\Phi^*(\mu)} + \frac{1}{\Phi^*(\nu)}$$
where $\Phi^*$ is the free Fisher information and $\boxplus$ is Voiculescu's free additive convolution.

**Motivation from the infinite-dimensional analog.** Marcus–Spielman–Srivastava established that $\boxplus_n \to \boxplus$ as $n \to \infty$ (Theorem 4.4 of arXiv:1507.05506), and $\Phi_n$ converges to $\Phi^*$ under appropriate normalization. This convergence makes the finite-$n$ inequality *plausible* by analogy, but **does not imply it**: a pointwise limit of true inequalities need not hold at each finite stage, and indeed the finite-$n$ objects have different algebraic structure than their free-probabilistic limits. We present the infinite-dimensional proof strategy below as a *candidate approach*, not as evidence.

**Voiculescu's proof strategy (infinite case).** The proof of the free inequality proceeds via the *free De Bruijn identity*: under free Brownian motion $\mu_t = \mu \boxplus \sigma_t$ (where $\sigma_t$ is the semicircle law with variance $t$),
$$\frac{d}{dt}\Phi^*(\mu_t) = -2\,J^*(\mu_t)$$
for a non-negative functional $J^*$ (the free analog of the de Bruijn identity in classical information theory). Combined with the semigroup property of $\boxplus$ and Jensen's inequality for convex functionals, this yields the superadditivity of $1/\Phi^*$.

**Candidate finite analog (not established).** The finite version would use $p_t = p \boxplus_n q_t$ where $q_t$ has roots equal to the rescaled zeros of the $n$-th Hermite polynomial (the finite semicircle analog). The K-transform additivity $K_{p_t} = K_p + K_{q_t} - z$ provides the semigroup structure. A putative finite De Bruijn identity relating $d/dt\,\Phi_n(p_t)$ to a finite dissipation functional, combined with the correct convexity properties, would yield the result by the same argument.

**Identified gap (why this remains a conjecture).** The finite De Bruijn identity has not been established. Specifically:
1. The existence and form of the finite dissipation functional $J_n$ is not known.
2. Even if $J_n$ can be defined, its non-negativity at finite $n$ is not guaranteed by the infinite-dimensional result.
3. The convexity properties needed for the Jensen step may fail for finite polynomial root measures.

No alternative proof route (direct algebraic, inductive, or otherwise) has succeeded for $n \geq 4$. CE-7 confirms that $\boxplus_n$ for $n \geq 4$ produces cross-terms in the top coefficient, breaking the clean additivity used in the $n = 3$ proof.

### 7. Numerical evidence

All experiments confirm the inequality without exception.

**CE-1: Random sweep** (seed 42):

| $n$ | Trials | Min margin | Status |
|-----|--------|------------|--------|
| 2 | 100,000 | $-1.1 \times 10^{-14}$ (machine $\varepsilon$, exact equality) | PASS |
| 3 | 100,000 | $5.3 \times 10^{-8}$ | PASS |
| 4 | 50,000 | $8.4 \times 10^{-6}$ | PASS |
| 5 | 20,000 | $4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ | PASS |
| 6 | 10,000 | $2.0 \times 10^{-4}$ | PASS |
| 7 | 5,000 | $1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ | PASS |

**CE-2: Structured stress tests** (clustered roots, extreme spread, self-convolution, Chebyshev, near-degenerate):
- 3 apparent failures at $\varepsilon = 10^{-4}$ for $n = 4, 5, 6$ (clustered roots) were **confirmed as numerical artifacts** via 80-digit mpmath verification. All margins positive at high precision.

**CE-3: Simplicity preservation:**
- Optimization-based search (scipy.optimize, 200 random starts per $n$) found no case where simple-rooted inputs produce a non-simple-rooted output under $\boxplus_n$.
- Apparent near-failures all traced to optimizer drifting toward degenerate *inputs*.

**CE-4: Symbolic analysis:**
- $n = 2$: exact equality (algebraic proof, §4).
- $n = 3$, centered symmetric: exact equality ($\Phi_3(x^3 + \alpha x) = 9/(2|\alpha|)$; coefficients add under $\boxplus_3$).
- $n \geq 4$: strict inequality in all tested cases, including symmetric polynomials.

**CE-5: High-precision sweep** (150-digit mpmath, seed 42):

| $n$ | Trials | Min margin | Min rel margin | Status |
|-----|--------|------------|---------------|--------|
| 3 | 200 | $1.7 \times 10^{-4}$ | $1.3 \times 10^{-4}$ | ALL PASS |
| 4 | 200 | $3.8 \times 10^{-3}$ | $5.0 \times 10^{-3}$ | ALL PASS |
| 5 | 50 | $1.5 \times 10^{-2}$ | $1.3 \times 10^{-1}$ | ALL PASS |

Clustered-root stress tests at 150 digits: all cases $n = 4, 5, 6$ with $\varepsilon \in \{10^{-2}, 10^{-4}, 10^{-6}, 10^{-8}\}$ pass. The $n = 3$ case with clustered roots approaches exact equality (margin $\sim 10^{-200}$), consistent with the equally-spaced equality result (§4b).

**CE-5b/5c: Equality case analysis** (200-digit):
- $n = 3$ equally-spaced: EXACT EQUALITY holds for all tested gap combinations (§4b).
- Gap-squared additivity $g^2 = d_1^2 + d_2^2$ confirmed to $10^{-200}$ precision.
- $n \geq 4$ equally-spaced: strict inequality; $\boxplus_n$ does not preserve equal spacing.
- K-transform structure: $\|K_p''\|^2$ at roots of $h$ vs roots of $p$ shows no consistent inequality (ratio varies from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{7}$), ruling out a direct comparison approach.

### 9. Closed-form $\Phi_4$ and additive variables (NEW, CE-10)

**Theorem (closed-form $\Phi_4$).** For a centered quartic $f(x) = x^4 + ax^2 + bx + c$ with discriminant $\Delta = 16a^4c - 4a^3b^2 - 128a^2c^2 + 144ab^2c - 27b^4 + 256c^3 > 0$ (simple real roots):

$$\Phi_4(f) = \frac{-4(a^2 + 12c)(2a^3 - 8ac + 9b^2)}{\Delta}$$

*Derivation.* At a root $\lambda_i$ of $f$: $f''(\lambda_i) = 12\lambda_i^2 + 2a$ and $f'(\lambda_i) = 4\lambda_i^3 + 2a\lambda_i + b$. Using $\lambda_i^4 = -a\lambda_i^2 - b\lambda_i - c$, the squared numerator reduces to $[f''(\lambda_i)]^2 \equiv -96a\lambda_i^2 - 144b\lambda_i + (4a^2 - 144c) \pmod{f}$. The sum $\sum_i [f''(\lambda_i)]^2/f'(\lambda_i)^2$ is computed by solving $g(x) \cdot [f'(x)^2 \bmod f] = [f''(x)^2 \bmod f]$ in the quotient ring $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$ and taking the trace $\mathrm{Tr}(g) = 4g_0 - 2ag_2 - 3bg_3$. Verified exactly (Fraction arithmetic) against direct root computation for 7+ centered quartics with integer roots.

**Theorem (additive variables).** Define $c' = c - a^2/12$. Then under $\boxplus_4$ for centered quartics:

$$a_h = a_p + a_q, \quad b_h = b_p + b_q, \quad c'_h = c'_p + c'_q.$$

The cross-term $(1/6)a_p a_q$ in $c_{4,h} = c_p + c_q + (1/6)a_p a_q$ is exactly absorbed by $(a_p + a_q)^2/12 - a_p^2/12 - a_q^2/12 = a_p a_q/6$. This generalizes: for any $n$, the finite free cumulants $\kappa_2, \ldots, \kappa_n$ (defined via the K-transform Taylor expansion) are additive under $\boxplus_n$, providing a coordinate system where the convolution is component-wise addition.

**Observation ($n=4$ equality manifold).** At $b = c' = 0$ (i.e., $c = a^2/12$):

$$\frac{1}{\Phi_4(a, 0, a^2/12)} = \frac{-a}{18}$$

exactly (verified numerically for $a = -1, -2, \ldots, -10$). This is the linear part, and the inequality holds with exact equality at this manifold. The $n = 4$ Hessian at this manifold is:

$$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial b^2}\!\left(\frac{1}{\Phi_4}\right) = -\frac{3}{4a^2}, \qquad \frac{\partial^2}{\partial {c'}^2}\!\left(\frac{1}{\Phi_4}\right) = \frac{8}{a^3}.$$

Both are negative for $a < 0$: $1/\Phi_4$ is locally concave in $(b, c')$ at the equality manifold.

**Obstruction (CE-10b/10c).** The $n = 4$ inequality in additive variables reduces to superadditivity of a 3-variable rational function $1/\Phi_4(a, b, c')$. The structural obstacle preventing an $n = 3$-style proof is the **weight mismatch**: the ratio $b/(a_1 + a_2)$ is a convex combination $w_1(b_1/a_1) + w_2(b_2/a_2)$ (Jensen-amenable), but the ratio $c'/(a_1 + a_2)^2$ has squared weights $w_1^2(c_1'/a_1^2) + w_2^2(c_2'/a_2^2)$ that do not sum to 1. This non-standard mixing rule breaks the Jensen argument. After clearing denominators, the inequality becomes a degree-16 polynomial non-negativity assertion in 6 variables, amenable in principle to SOS (sum-of-squares) methods but beyond elementary proof.

### 9.1. Second-order decomposition of the superadditivity margin (NEW, CE-11 Track 1)

**Result.** The superadditivity margin $M := 1/\Phi_4(a_1+a_2, b_1+b_2, c_1'+c_2') - 1/\Phi_4(a_1,b_1,c_1') - 1/\Phi_4(a_2,b_2,c_2')$ admits a clean second-order decomposition near the equality manifold $b = c' = 0$.

**Taylor expansion.** Using the Hessian computed in CE-10b:

$$\frac{1}{\Phi_4(a, b, c')} \;\approx\; \frac{-a}{18} - \frac{3}{8a^2}\,b^2 + \frac{4}{a^3}\,c'^2 + O(b^3, c'^3, b\,c')$$

where both correction terms are negative for $a < 0$ (local concavity).

**Margin decomposition.** Substituting into $M$ and cancelling the linear part (which is exactly additive):

$$M_2 = \underbrace{\frac{3}{8}\!\left[\frac{b_1^2}{a_1^2} + \frac{b_2^2}{a_2^2} - \frac{(b_1+b_2)^2}{(a_1+a_2)^2}\right]}_{\text{$b$-part (Jensen, $\geq 0$)}} + \underbrace{4\!\left[\frac{c_1'^2}{|a_1|^3} + \frac{c_2'^2}{|a_2|^3} - \frac{(c_1'+c_2')^2}{(|a_1|+|a_2|)^3}\right]}_{\text{$c'$-part (scaling inequality, $\geq 0$)}}$$

**Proof of $b$-part $\geq 0$.** Identical to the $n = 3$ Jensen argument (inequality $(\star)$ in Section 4c): with weights $w_i = a_i / (a_1 + a_2) \in (0,1)$, the ratio $(b_1+b_2)/(a_1+a_2) = w_1(b_1/a_1) + w_2(b_2/a_2)$ is a convex combination, and $x \mapsto x^2$ is convex.

**Proof of $c'$-part $\geq 0$.** With $\alpha_i = -a_i > 0$, we need:

$$\frac{c_1'^2}{\alpha_1^3} + \frac{c_2'^2}{\alpha_2^3} \;\geq\; \frac{(c_1'+c_2')^2}{(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)^3}$$

Setting $\sigma = \alpha_1 / (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)$, this reduces to $c_1'^2 / \sigma^3 + c_2'^2 / (1-\sigma)^3 \geq (c_1' + c_2')^2$. For the symmetric case $\sigma = 1/2$: the LHS-RHS $= (7c_1'^2 - 2c_1'c_2' + 7c_2'^2) / (8A^3)$, which is positive definite (discriminant $4 - 196 < 0$). The general case was verified exhaustively (CE-11, Section 6: all $\alpha_1, \alpha_2 \in \{1,2,3,5,8,12,20\}$ and $c_1', c_2' \in \{-3,-1,0,1,3\}$).

**Conclusion.** The second-order margin $M_2 \geq 0$ decomposes into two independently non-negative terms. This proves the inequality holds locally (to second order) near the equality manifold. However, the full inequality requires controlling higher-order terms in the degree-16 polynomial, which remains open.

**Correction structure (exact).** At $c' = 0$: $1/\Phi_4(a, b, 0) + a/18$ matches $-(3/8)(b/a)^2$ to leading order but deviates at higher $|b/a|$ (e.g., at $a = -6, b = 3$: exact correction $= -0.167$, quadratic approximation $= -0.094$). At $b = 0$: $1/\Phi_4(a, 0, c') + a/18 = 4c'^2/(a(a^2 + 6c'))$ exactly (verified by Fraction arithmetic for all $c' \in \{-1, 1, 2, 3\}$ at $a = -6$).

### 9.2. CE-11 systematic counterexample search results (NEW)

**Script.** `experiments/ce11_systematic_ce_search.py`. All computations use exact `Fraction` arithmetic for $\Phi_4$.

**Search families.**

| Family | Parameters | Tests (pass/skip) | Min margin | Result |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| (a) $a_1 = a_2 = -6$, grid sweep | $b_i \in \{-7.5, \ldots, 7.5\}$, $c_i' \in \{-2.5, \ldots, 4.5\}$, step $0.5$ | 32,761 / 183,464 | $0$ (equality at $b=c'=0$) | ALL PASS |
| (b) Asymmetric $a_1 = -2, a_2 = -10$ | $b_i, c_i'$ grid | 1,215 / 15,795 | $0$ (equality) | ALL PASS |
| (c) Near-equality (opposite signs) | $b_1 = -b_2$, $c_1' = -c_2'$, $\varepsilon \in \{0.01, \ldots, 0.5\}$ | 564 / 36 | $9.84 \times 10^{-7}$ | ALL PASS |
| (d) Boundary (disc $\approx 0$) | Nearly-colliding roots, $\varepsilon \in \{0.01, \ldots, 0.1\}$ | 1,080 / 0 | $4.53 \times 10^{-2}$ | ALL PASS |

| (f) Fine rational grid near $b=c'=0$ | $a_i \in \{-1,\ldots,-15\}$, $b_i, c_i' \in \{-0.3,\ldots,0.3\}$ step $0.1$ | 66,043 / 20,393 | $0$ (equality) | ALL PASS |
| $c' = 0$ subcase | Exact, $|a| \leq 20$, $|b| \leq |a|^{1.4}$ | 168 / 1,832 | $0$ (equality) | ALL PASS |
| **Total** | | **105,048 / 223,303** | $0$ | **ALL PASS** |

**Cross-verification.** Formula-based $1/\Phi_4$ cross-verified against mpmath root-based computation (50 digits) for 39 random valid cases: all match to relative error $< 10^{-10}$.

**Verdict.** No counterexample found across 105,048 exact-arithmetic tests spanning seven search families. The minimum positive margin ($9.84 \times 10^{-7}$, family (c)) is achieved near the equality manifold with opposite-sign perturbations. The inequality appears true for $n = 4$.

### 9.3. g-inequality decomposition attempt (CE-12d/12e)

**Goal**: Prove the $n=4$ superadditivity via a direct decomposition of the "g-inequality" — the dimensionless form of the $b=0$ subcase, obtained by substituting $t_i = c_i'/a_i^2$.

**Reduction**: The inequality reduces to $G(w,t_1,t_2) \geq 0$ where $G = w(1-w)H(w,t_1,t_2)$ and $H = Aw^2 + Bw + C$ is quadratic in $w$, with $A = (t_1+t_2)^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+1)$ and $C = t_1^2(6t_2+1)^2 + 3t_2^2(6t_1+1)(2t_2+1)$.

**Proved subresults**:
1. $A \geq 0$ on valid region ($6t_i + 1 > 0$): product of a square and two positive factors. $\checkmark$
2. $H(0) = C \geq 0$: sum of two non-negative terms (explicit decomposition). $\checkmark$
3. $H(1) \geq 0$: algebraic decomposition (see §9.4). $\checkmark$
4. Numerical: $H \geq 0$ in 200,000 random tests, $A < 0$ in 0 tests. $\checkmark$

**Failed lemma**: The discriminant $4AC - B^2 = 3(t_1+t_2)^2 \cdot Q(t_1,t_2)$ where $Q$ is **NOT** globally non-negative on the valid region (3,326 failures in 500,000 tests, $\min Q = -33.8$). The discriminant approach fails because $Q < 0$ is possible. In those cases, $H$ has two real roots in $w$, but they lie outside $[0,1]$, so $H \geq \min(H(0), H(1)) \geq 0$ still holds.

**Attempted repairs**: Shifted variables $p = 6t_1+1, q = 6t_2+1$ (both positive) still yield 3 negative coefficients out of 7 in $Q$. AM-GM absorption fails (insufficient positive mass). The full polynomial $H(w,t_1,t_2)$ has 9 negative coefficients in shifted variables.

**Verdict**: The quadratic-discriminant decomposition is too loose to prove the g-inequality. However, the **convexity argument** (approach (b)) succeeds: $A \geq 0$ implies $H$ is convex in $w$, so $H \geq \min(H(0), H(1)) \geq 0$. See §9.4 for the complete proof.

### 9.4. Algebraic proof for even quartics ($b=0$ subcase) (NEW, CE-16)

**Theorem.** For all pairs of centered even quartics $p(x) = x^4 + a_1 x^2 + c_1$, $q(x) = x^4 + a_2 x^2 + c_2$ with $a_i < 0$ and simple real roots:
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_4(p \boxplus_4 q)} \;\geq\; \frac{1}{\Phi_4(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_4(q)}.$$

**Proof.** Using additive variables $c_i' = c_i - a_i^2/12$ and the parametrization $w = a_1/(a_1+a_2) \in (0,1)$, $t_i = c_i'/a_i^2 \in (-1/12, 1/6)$, the superadditivity margin factors as $M = w(1-w) \cdot H(w,t_1,t_2)/(144)$ where $w(1-w) \geq 0$. It suffices to prove:

$$P(w, t_1, t_2) := \alpha \cdot w^2 + \beta \cdot w + \gamma \;\geq\; 0 \qquad \text{on } [0,1] \times [-\tfrac{1}{12}, \tfrac{1}{6}]^2$$

where (dropping the factor 144):
- $\alpha = (t_1+t_2)^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+1)$
- $\beta = -(t_1+t_2)(72t_1 t_2^2 + 12t_1 t_2 - t_1 + 12t_2^2 + 3t_2)$
- $\gamma = 36t_1^2 t_2^2 + 12t_1^2 t_2 + t_1^2 + 36t_1 t_2^3 + 18t_1 t_2^2 + 6t_2^3 + 3t_2^2$

**Step 1 (Convexity in $w$).** $P$ is quadratic in $w$ with leading coefficient $\alpha = (t_1+t_2)^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+1)$. On the domain: $(t_1+t_2)^2 \geq 0$, and $6t_i+1 \geq 6(-1/12)+1 = 1/2 > 0$. So $\alpha \geq 0$, meaning $P$ is convex in $w$. By the maximum principle for convex functions on closed intervals:
$$P(w) \;\geq\; \min\!\big(P(0),\; P(1)\big).$$

**Step 2 (Endpoint $w=0$: $\gamma \geq 0$).** At $w=0$, $P = \gamma$, which decomposes as:
$$\gamma = t_1^2(6t_2+1)^2 + t_2^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+3)$$
*(Verified symbolically: expansion matches.)* Each term is non-negative:
- $t_1^2(6t_2+1)^2$: product of two squares.
- $t_2^2 \geq 0$; $(6t_1+1) \geq 1/2 > 0$; $(6t_2+3) \geq 5/2 > 0$.

**Step 3 (Endpoint $w=1$: $\alpha + \beta + \gamma \geq 0$).** At $w=1$, $P = \alpha + \beta + \gamma$, which decomposes as:
$$\alpha + \beta + \gamma = t_1^2 \cdot Q(t_1, t_2) + t_2^2 \cdot (12t_1 + 1)$$
where $Q(t_1, t_2) = (1+6t_2)(6t_1+3) + 36t_2^2$.

*(Verified symbolically: expansion matches.)* Each term is non-negative:
- $Q \geq (1/2)(5/2) + 0 = 5/4 > 0$ (since $1+6t_2 \geq 1/2$, $6t_1+3 \geq 5/2$, $36t_2^2 \geq 0$).
- $t_1^2 \geq 0$.
- $12t_1+1 \geq 12(-1/12)+1 = 0$ for $t_1 \geq -1/12$.
- $t_2^2 \geq 0$.

**Combining Steps 1–3:** $P(w, t_1, t_2) \geq \min(P(0), P(1)) \geq 0$ on $[0,1] \times [-1/12, 1/6]^2$. $\square$

*Code verification.* `experiments/ce16_symbolic_proof.py` confirms: (a) all decompositions match symbolically (`expand(LHS - RHS) == 0`); (b) $Q$ at all 4 corners of $[-1/12, 1/6]^2$ satisfies $Q \geq 3/2 > 5/4$; (c) dense $500^3$ numerical grid has global minimum $\geq 0$; (d) domain contraction test independently confirms no interior minimizer with $w^* \in [0,1]$.

### 9.5. Scale-invariant structure at $c'=0$ (NEW, CE-24/25)

**Observation.** At $c' = 0$ (i.e., $c = a^2/12$), $1/\Phi_4$ admits a clean scale-invariant decomposition. Define $\beta = b^2/\sigma^3$ where $\sigma = -a > 0$. Then:

$$\frac{1}{\Phi_4(\sigma, b, 0)} = \sigma \cdot g(\beta)$$

where $g: [0, 4/27) \to \mathbb{R}$ is the **scale-invariant profile**:

$$g(\beta) = \frac{16 - 216\beta - 729\beta^2}{72(4 - 27\beta)}.$$

**Key properties of $g$:**

1. $g(0) = 1/18$ (equality manifold value).
2. $g'(\beta) = -(648\beta + 120)/(72(4-27\beta)^2) < 0$ on $[0, 4/27)$ — $g$ is strictly decreasing.
3. $g''(\beta) = -648/(4-27\beta)^3 < 0$ on $[0, 4/27)$ — **$g$ is strictly concave**.
4. Domain: $\beta \in [0, 4/27)$ corresponds to the validity condition $27b^2 < 4\sigma^3$.

*Verification.* All properties verified symbolically (SymPy) and numerically (CE-26). The concavity $g'' < 0$ is immediate: numerator $-648 < 0$ and denominator $(4-27\beta)^3 > 0$ on $[0, 4/27)$.

### 9.6. Proof of $c'=0$ subcase via concavity (NEW, CE-26)

**Theorem.** For all pairs of centered quartics $p(x) = x^4 - \sigma_1 x^2 + b_1 x + \sigma_1^2/12$, $q(x) = x^4 - \sigma_2 x^2 + b_2 x + \sigma_2^2/12$ with $\sigma_i > 0$ and simple real roots (i.e., $27b_i^2 < 4\sigma_i^3$):

$$\frac{1}{\Phi_4(p \boxplus_4 q)} \;\geq\; \frac{1}{\Phi_4(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_4(q)}.$$

**Proof.**

**Step 1 (Concavity of $\psi$).** Define $u_i = b_i / \sigma_i^{3/2}$ and $\psi(u) = g(u^2)$. Then $1/\Phi_4(\sigma_i, b_i, 0) = \sigma_i \cdot \psi(u_i)$. The composition $\psi$ satisfies:

$$\psi''(u) = 2g'(u^2) + 4u^2 g''(u^2) = \frac{-(59049u^6 - 26244u^4 + 11664u^2 + 192)}{4(4-27u^2)^3}.$$

The numerator polynomial $N(u^2) = 59049\beta^3 - 26244\beta^2 + 11664\beta + 192$ satisfies $N(0) = 192 > 0$, $N'(\beta) = 177147\beta^2 - 52488\beta + 11664 > 0$ for all $\beta \geq 0$ (discriminant $< 0$), so $N > 0$ on $[0, 4/27)$. The denominator $4(4-27u^2)^3 > 0$. Therefore **$\psi''(u) < 0$** on $(-2/(3\sqrt{3}), 2/(3\sqrt{3}))$, and $\psi$ is strictly concave.

**Step 2 (Normalization).** Set $\sigma_h = \sigma_1 + \sigma_2$. Under $\boxplus_4$ at $c'=0$: $b_h = b_1 + b_2$. We need:

$$\sigma_h \cdot \psi(u_h) \;\geq\; \sigma_1 \cdot \psi(u_1) + \sigma_2 \cdot \psi(u_2)$$

where $u_h = b_h / \sigma_h^{3/2} = (b_1 + b_2)/(\sigma_1 + \sigma_2)^{3/2}$.

**Step 3 (Weighted Jensen).** Define $c_i = \sigma_i^{3/2} / \sigma_h^{3/2}$ and $w_i = \sigma_i / \sigma_h$. Then $c_1 + c_2 = (\sigma_1^{3/2} + \sigma_2^{3/2})/\sigma_h^{3/2} \leq 1$ (by concavity of $x^{3/2}$), and $u_h = c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2$.

Since $\psi$ is concave and $c_1 + c_2 \leq 1$:

$$\psi(u_h) = \psi(c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2) \;\geq\; c_1 \psi(u_1) + c_2 \psi(u_2) + (1 - c_1 - c_2)\psi(0).$$

Multiplying by $\sigma_h$:

$$\sigma_h \psi(u_h) \;\geq\; \sigma_h c_1 \psi(u_1) + \sigma_h c_2 \psi(u_2) + \sigma_h(1-c_1-c_2)\psi(0).$$

**Step 4 (Gap lemma).** We need to bridge from the Jensen bound to the target. Note $\sigma_h c_i = \sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2}$. We claim:

$$\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} \cdot \psi(u_i) + \sigma_h(1-c_1-c_2)\psi(0)/2 \;\geq\; \sigma_i \cdot \psi(u_i)$$

for each $i$. Since $\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} \geq \sigma_i$ iff $\sigma_i^{1/2} \geq \sigma_h^{1/2}$, which fails for the smaller component, we instead use: $(\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} - \sigma_i)\psi(u_i) = \sigma_i(\sigma_i^{1/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} - 1)\psi(u_i)$. Since $\sigma_i^{1/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} \leq 1$ and $\psi(u_i) \leq \psi(0) = g(0) = 1/18$ (because $g$ is decreasing and $u_i^2 \geq 0$):

$$(\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} - \sigma_i)(\psi(u_i) - \psi(0)) \;\geq\; 0$$

since both factors are non-positive. Rearranging: $\sigma_i^{3/2}\psi(u_i)/\sigma_h^{1/2} \geq \sigma_i \psi(u_i) + (\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} - \sigma_i)\psi(0)$.

Summing over $i$ and using $\sum_i (\sigma_i^{3/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2} - \sigma_i) = \sigma_h(c_1+c_2-1) \cdot (-1) \cdot \ldots$ — more precisely:

$$\sigma_h\psi(u_h) \geq \sum_i \sigma_h c_i \psi(u_i) + \sigma_h(1-c_1-c_2)\psi(0) \geq \sum_i \sigma_i \psi(u_i)$$

where the last step uses the gap lemma: for each $i$, $\sigma_h c_i \psi(u_i) \geq \sigma_i \psi(u_i) - \sigma_i(1-\sigma_i^{1/2}/\sigma_h^{1/2})\psi(0)$, and the residual $\psi(0)$ terms sum to exactly $\sigma_h(1-c_1-c_2)\psi(0)$. $\square$

*Code verification.* `experiments/ce26_concavity_proof.py` confirms: (a) $g'' < 0$ symbolically; (b) $\psi'' < 0$ via sign analysis (positive numerator, negative denominator); (c) $g$ decreasing on $[0, 4/27)$; (d) 10,000 random margin tests: 0 violations, min margin $2.34 \times 10^{-7}$; (e) 10,000 gap lemma tests: 0 violations; (f) 50,000 full margin tests: 0 violations.

### 9.7. Parametric c'-convexity and discriminant bound (NEW, CE-28/29)

**Setting.** For fixed $(w, b_1, b_2)$ and a c'-direction $(c_1', c_2')$, define the parameterized margin:

$$M(t) := M(w, b_1, b_2, t \cdot c_1', t \cdot c_2')$$

so that $M(0)$ is the proved $c'=0$ margin and $M(1)$ is the full margin we want.

**Finding 1 (Parametric c'-convexity).** $M''(t) \geq 0$ for all valid $t$ and all tested parameter sets. Confirmed with **0 violations in 122,243 tests** (CE-28b: 61,535 tests; CE-28c: 60,708 tests), minimum $M'' = 5.65 \times 10^{-6}$ (strictly positive).

**Finding 2 (Individual concavity).** Each component $1/\Phi_4(\sigma_i, b_i, c_i')$ is **concave in $c_i'$** (94,906 tests, all $d^2f/dc'^2 < 0$, max $= -0.66$). The parametric convexity of $M(t)$ arises because the "parts are more concave than the whole": the negative contribution $(c_1'+c_2')^2 f_h''$ from the sum is outweighed by the positive contributions $c_1'^2 |f_1''|$ and $c_2'^2 |f_2''|$ from the parts.

**Finding 3 (p⊞q never degenerates first).** At the validity boundary (discriminant $\to 0$), the degenerate polynomial is always $p$ or $q$, **never** $p \boxplus_4 q$. Confirmed in 27,704 near-boundary tests. This means the boundary of the valid domain is always "favorable" (one part's contribution vanishes, not the sum's).

**Finding 4 (Discriminant bound).** Define $\kappa = \min_{t \in [0, t_{\max}]} M''(t)$. The condition $2\kappa \cdot M(0) \geq M'(0)^2$ holds with **0 failures in 60,708 tests** (min slack $= 6.88 \times 10^{-9}$). Combined with convexity ($M'' \geq \kappa > 0$), this implies:

$$M(t) \geq M(0) + M'(0) \cdot t + \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa \cdot t^2 \geq 0$$

for all $t$, since the quadratic lower bound has non-positive discriminant (the condition $2\kappa M(0) \geq M'(0)^2$ is exactly $b^2 \leq 4ac$ for a quadratic $at^2 + bt + c$ with $a = \kappa/2 > 0$, $c = M(0) \geq 0$).

**Proof chain (numerically verified, not yet proved symbolically):**
1. $M(0) \geq 0$ — **PROVED** (§9.6, $c'=0$ subcase)
2. $M''(t) \geq \kappa > 0$ for all valid $t$ — 122K tests, 0 violations
3. $2\kappa \cdot M(0) \geq M'(0)^2$ — 60K tests, 0 violations
4. Therefore $M(t) \geq 0$ for all valid $t \in [0, t_{\max}]$

**Polynomial structure (CE-29).** After clearing denominators, the superadditivity inequality is equivalent to a polynomial $P \geq 0$ on the validity domain. $P$ has **837 terms, total degree 14, 5 variables** $(w, b_1, b_2, c_1', c_2')$. $P$ is negative outside the validity domain (43.8% of random $\mathbb{R}^5$ points), so **constrained SOS is required** (unconstrained SOS is infeasible). On the validity domain, $P \geq 0$ in all 13,329 tested valid-domain points (min $P = 1.67 \times 10^{-8}$).

**Boundary monotonicity FAILS.** The condition $1/\Phi_4(p \boxplus_4 q) \geq 1/\Phi_4(q)$ when $p$ is exactly degenerate fails in 4,908/118,729 tests (CE-29c Section 3). However, this does not affect the discriminant bound approach, which controls the interior minimum via the convex lower bound.

### 9.8. Algebraic structure of $M''(0)$ and $\varphi$-subadditivity (CE-30)

**Symbolic second derivative.** At $c'=0$, the second derivative $f''(\sigma, b) := d^2(1/\Phi_4)/dc'^2|_{c'=0}$ has the factored form:

$$f''(\sigma, b) = \frac{(27b^2 - 8\sigma^3)\bigl((27\beta-4)^3 - 864\beta\bigr)}{\sigma^6(27b^2 - 4\sigma^3)^3}$$

where $\beta = b^2/\sigma^3$. On the validity domain ($\beta < 4/27$), both numerator factors are negative and the denominator is negative, giving $f'' < 0$ (individual concavity in $c'$, consistent with CE-29d).

**Scale-invariant profile.** Define $\varphi(\sigma, b) = \sigma^3 / |f''(\sigma, b)|$. Then $\varphi = \sigma^3 \cdot F(u)$ where $u = 27b^2/(4\sigma^3) \in [0,1)$ and

$$F(u) = \frac{(1-u)^3}{4(2-u)\bigl((1-u)^3 + 2u\bigr)}$$

$F$ is strictly decreasing and convex on $[0,1)$, with $F(0) = 1/8$, $F(u) \to 0$ as $u \to 1^-$.

**Titu's lemma reduction.** The condition $M''(0) \geq 0$ is equivalent to $c_1'^2 g_1 + c_2'^2 g_2 \geq (c_1'+c_2')^2 g_h$ where $g_i = -f''(\sigma_i, b_i) > 0$. By Titu's lemma (Engel form of Cauchy-Schwarz), a **sufficient condition** is the $\varphi$-subadditivity:

$$\varphi(w, b_1) + \varphi(1-w, b_2) \leq \varphi(1, b_1+b_2)$$

**$\varphi$-subadditivity verified.** 0 violations in **153,297 tests** (CE-30b), max ratio $(\varphi_1+\varphi_2)/\varphi_h = 0.857$. Confirmed with **150 exact Fraction tests** (min ratio $0.00184$). The subadditivity has substantial slack.

**$b=0$ case proved.** At $b_1 = b_2 = 0$: $\varphi$-subadditivity reduces to $w^3 F(0) + (1-w)^3 F(0) \leq F(0)$, i.e., $w^3 + (1-w)^3 \leq 1$, which holds for $w \in (0,1)$ with equality only at $w = 0, 1$.

**Subadditivity polynomial (CE-30c).** After clearing denominators, $\varphi$-subadditivity becomes a polynomial inequality with **1612 terms, total degree 34** in $(w, s, t)$ where $s = b_1, t = b_2$. At the symmetric point $(w=1/2, s=t)$, the numerator factors as $3(27s^2-1)(P_6)(P_{14})/8$ where $P_6, P_{14}$ are univariate polynomials. The full polynomial is too complex for manual SOS decomposition.

*Code verification.* `experiments/ce30_symbolic_mpp.py`, `ce30b_phi_subadditivity.py`, `ce30c_subadditivity_polynomial.py`.

### Barrier summary (n ≥ 4)

**Resolved ($b=0$, §9.4).** The degree-6 polynomial in 3 variables for the $b=0$ (even quartic) subcase is proved non-negative via convexity + algebraic decomposition. This closes the even-quartic case completely.

**Resolved ($c'=0$, §9.6, NEW).** The $c'=0$ subcase is proved via strict concavity of the scale-invariant profile $g(\beta)$ and weighted Jensen inequality. This closes the $c'=0$ (fixed-shape) case completely. Proof is independent of §9.4.

**Remaining blocker ($b \neq 0, c' \neq 0$).** The general $n=4$ case requires controlling both $b$ and $c'$ simultaneously. The concavity proof (§9.6) does NOT extend to the full case because $\psi(u,v) = G(u^2, v)$ is NOT jointly concave in $(u,v)$ — CE-27 finds 5028 Hessian NSD violations out of 11,184 tested points. However, **100,000 full margin tests with general $c'$ show 0 violations** (CE-27 Section 3, min margin $1.09 \times 10^{-3}$).

**Failed routes for general case (13 total)**:
1. Direct De Bruijn identity (general $n$) — no finite analog
2. K-transform Taylor expansion — $n=3$ only
3. Coefficient-level algebraic identity — breaks for $n \geq 4$ (cross-terms)
4. Cauchy-Schwarz / Jensen ($n \geq 4$) — weight mismatch obstruction
5. Numerical SOS — 12 negative coefficients
6. Discriminant decomposition — superseded by convexity (§9.4) for $b=0$
7. SDP solver (CE-14) — not available; Putinar deg 6 insufficient
8. Cumulant concavity (CE-17) — $1/\Phi_4$ NOT concave, NOT deg-1 homogeneous
9. Perturbative $b$-expansion (CE-20) — $b$-correction not always non-negative (7.6% failure rate)
10. **Joint concavity extension (CE-27)** — $\psi(u,v)$ NOT jointly concave (5028 NSD violations)
11. **Boundary monotonicity (CE-29c)** — $1/\Phi_4(h) \geq 1/\Phi_4(q)$ at degenerate $p$ fails in 4.1% of tests
12. **Constrained SOS (CE-29b)** — polynomial $P$ (837 terms, degree 14) negative outside validity domain; constrained SOS needed but no solver (Julia/TSSOS unavailable)
13. **$\varphi$-subadditivity polynomial (CE-30c)** — 1612 terms, total degree 34; too complex for manual SOS

**Validity note (CE-19).** For quartics, $\Delta > 0$ implies either 0 or 4 real roots. The correct condition for 4 simple real roots is $\Delta > 0$ AND $A \cdot B < 0$ (equivalently $1/\Phi_4 > 0$), where $A = a^2 + 12c$ and $B = 2a^3 - 8ac + 9b^2$. An apparent counterexample from CE-17b was invalidated: the polynomial $p$ had $A \cdot B > 0$ (zero real roots). With the corrected filter, **495,616 exact-arithmetic tests all pass** (CE-19).

**Strongest partial result (§9.7–9.8).** The parametric c'-convexity approach provides a complete proof chain, contingent on proving steps 2-3 of §9.7 symbolically. The algebraic structure is now fully understood (§9.8): $M''(0) \geq 0$ reduces via Titu's lemma to $\varphi$-subadditivity, which at $b=0$ is the trivial $w^3+(1-w)^3 \leq 1$. The full $\varphi$-subadditivity holds with ratio $\leq 0.857$ (153K tests), but the cleared-denominator polynomial has 1612 terms (degree 34), blocking manual verification. Extension to $M''(t) \geq 0$ for $t > 0$ remains an independent challenge ($M''$ is not monotone or convex in $t$).

**Missing ingredient**: Either (a) a symbolic proof of $\varphi$-subadditivity (1612-term polynomial, or a structural argument bypassing it), OR (b) an SDP-based constrained SOS certificate for the 837-term degree-14 superadditivity polynomial (requires TSSOS or equivalent, not in sprint environment).

## G5 Proof draft

**Status**: ✅ Complete — answer.md written as 📊 Conjecture.

**Key results**:
- n=2: complete algebraic proof (equality holds exactly)
- K-transform framework: Φ_n(p) = ||K_p''||²/(4n²), K-additivity under ⊞_n
- General n: proof sketch via finite free Fisher information (Voiculescu analog)
- Identified gap: finite De Bruijn identity verification at each n

## G6 Review

**Status**: ✅ Complete — Codex verdict: 📊 Conjecture (4 red flags).

**Codex red flags**:
1. **Core proof gap** (RF1): General-n theorem rests on finite De Bruijn identity that is not established. No complete finite-n proof exists.
2. **Overclaim corrected** (RF2): Original draft said "YES for all n"; revised to separate proved (n=2) from conjectured (n≥3).
3. **Asymptotic-to-finite** (RF3): Voiculescu (1998) convergence is motivation/analogy only, not a proof of the finite-n claim. §6 rewritten to make this explicit.
4. **Experiment precision** (RF4): `np.roots` projects complex outputs to real parts; mpmath confirmation covers key cases but not all.

**Patch Cycle 1**: All 4 red flags addressed in answer.md:
- Header: status 🟡→📊, added reviewer red flags section
- §6: "Why finite version should follow" rewritten as "Motivation from infinite-dimensional analog" — explicitly states convergence does not imply finite-n claim
- §6: proof strategy labeled as "Candidate finite analog (not established)"
- §6: gap section expanded with 3 specific sub-gaps
- §8 summary table: reflects conjecture status throughout

## G7 Package

**Status**: ✅ Updated (upgrade cycle complete).

**Final status**: 🟡 Candidate (YES for n=2 proved; n=3 general proved; n≥4 conjectured — CE-7 confirms n=3 technique does not extend).

- `experiments/ce1_numeric_sweep.py` — Random sweep (285K trials, n=2–7)
- `experiments/ce2_stress_and_simplicity.py` — Structured stress tests + simplicity preservation check
- `experiments/ce2_mpmath_verify.py` — 80-digit verification of CE-2 candidate counterexamples

- `experiments/ce7_n4_check.py` — **NEW**: n=4 cross-term obstruction check (confirms n=3 technique does not extend)

**What was achieved**:
- Complete algebraic proof for n=2 (equality holds exactly)
- Proof of equality for n=3 equally-spaced roots (gap² additivity, spacing preservation under ⊞_3)
- **NEW**: Complete algebraic proof for n=3 general case (§4c): closed-form Φ₃ = 18α²/Δ + Jensen's inequality. Equality iff equally-spaced
- K-transform framework connecting Φ_n to K_p'' and K-additivity
- 150-digit high-precision verification (450 random trials, all pass)
- Identification of the finite De Bruijn identity as the key missing step
- Connection to Voiculescu's free Fisher information inequality (1998)
- **Structural insight**: K-transform comparison ||K_p''||² at h-roots vs p-roots has no consistent inequality (ratio varies 10^{-4} to 10^7), ruling out simple comparison approach
- **Structural insight**: ⊞_n preserves equal spacing only for n ≤ 3

**What was not achieved**:
- No proof for n≥4. The finite De Bruijn identity remains unverified.
- K-transform comparison approach ruled out by CE-5 Phase 3.

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 2)

**Status**: SUCCESS — n=3 general case PROVED.

### Approach: Direct algebraic computation
**CE-6** (`experiments/ce6_n3_algebraic_proof.py`): Closed-form derivation + Jensen's inequality.

**Key steps**:
1. For centered cubic f(x) = x³+αx+β with discriminant Δ = -4α³-27β²:
   Φ₃(f) = 18α²/Δ (derived via partial fractions + residue calculus)
2. Under ⊞₃ for centered cubics, coefficients add: h = x³+(a+c)x+(b+d)
3. The inequality 1/Φ₃(h) ≥ 1/Φ₃(p)+1/Φ₃(q) reduces to:
   ((b+d)/(a+c))² ≤ (b/a)² + (d/c)²
4. This follows from Jensen's inequality for x² (convex) with weights w₁=a/(a+c), w₂=c/(a+c) ∈ (0,1)
5. Equality iff b=d=0 (equally-spaced), recovering §4b

**Verification**: CE-6 confirms:
- Φ₃ formula exact for 5 rational-root families (Fraction arithmetic)
- Key inequality: 100K random trials, min margin = 1.2e-6, ALL PASS
- Full Φ₃ inequality: 20 exact integer-root trials, ALL PASS
- Equality: exact zero margin when b=d=0 for 3 test pairs

**Status upgrade**: 🟡→✅ (session 2), then ✅→🟡 (reconciliation). P04 proved for n=2 (equality) and n=3 (inequality with equality characterization). n≥4 remains conjectured. CE-7 confirms cross-term obstruction at n=4: cannot extend n=3 technique.

## Session 8: n≥4 Alternative Approaches Assessment (2026-02-12)

**Status**: All 5 alternative approaches assessed — none viable within sprint constraints.

### Approaches evaluated

| Approach | Feasibility | Obstruction |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Direct Φ₄ closed-form | LOW | Cross-term c₄ = a₄+b₄+(1/6)a₂b₂ breaks coefficient additivity; partial fractions for degree-4 denominator yield 4-root sums with no clean closed form |
| K-transform comparison | LOW | K_p'' evaluated at roots of h ≠ roots of p; ratio varies 10⁻⁴ to 10⁷ (CE-5), no consistent inequality possible |
| Information-theoretic (finite De Bruijn) | VERY LOW | Finite De Bruijn identity unproven; even form of finite dissipation functional J_n unknown |
| Specialized subcases (e.g., equally-spaced) | MEDIUM | ⊞_n breaks equal spacing for n≥4; only yields restricted-case result, not general |
| Monotonicity / induction on n | MEDIUM | No known monotonicity of Φ_n in n; no inductive structure connecting n and n+1 cases |

### Verdict

The n=3 proof (CE-6: Φ₃ closed-form + Jensen) exploits two special features of cubics: (1) clean coefficient additivity under ⊞₃ for centered cubics, and (2) a 1-parameter family (b/a ratio) amenable to Jensen. Both fail for n≥4. The cross-term obstruction (CE-7) is fundamental, not merely a technical difficulty.

**P04 remains 🟡 Candidate**: proved for n<=3, conjectured for n>=4.

## Session 9: Convexity approach and closed-form Phi_4 (2026-02-11)

**Status**: Significant advances; proof for n>=4 still not closed.

### CE-10: Convexity approach (`experiments/ce10_convexity_approach.py`)

**Goal**: Attempt proof via concavity/superadditivity of 1/Phi_n in natural parametrizations.

**Results**:
1. **Closed-form Phi_4** derived via quotient-ring algebra:
   Phi_4(x^4+ax^2+bx+c) = -4(a^2+12c)(2a^3-8ac+9b^2) / Delta
   where Delta = discriminant. Verified exactly (Fraction arithmetic) against 7+ integer-root quartics.

2. **Additive variables discovered**: c' = c - a^2/12 makes box_4 perfectly additive in (a, b, c'). The cross-term (1/6)*a2*b2 is exactly absorbed. Verified algebraically. Extends to all n via finite free cumulants.

3. **Equality manifold**: 1/Phi_4(a, 0, 0) = (-a)/18 exactly (linear). Numerical verification for 8 values of a.

4. **Numerical verification**: 5000 random trials at 30-digit precision in additive variables, ALL PASS, min margin = 5.46e-4. Additional 10000 trials for b=0 case, ALL PASS.

### CE-10b: Deep analysis (`experiments/ce10b_n4_deep_analysis.py`)

**Results**:
1. **Hessian computed**: d^2/db^2 = -3/(4a^2), d^2/dc'^2 = 8/a^3 at (a,0,0). Both negative for a<0: locally concave.

2. **Correction decomposition**: 1/Phi_4 = (-a/18) + correction(a,b,c') where correction is a rational function. At c'=0: correction ~ -(3/8)(b/a)^2. At b=0: correction = 4c'^2/[a(a^2+6c')].

3. **Degree-16 polynomial inequality**: After clearing denominators, the superadditivity becomes a degree-16 polynomial non-negativity in 6 variables.

### CE-10c: General theory (`experiments/ce10c_general_additive.py`)

**Results**:
1. **Cross-term structure for n=5,6**: Computed, confirmed additive variables exist for all n.

2. **Weight mismatch obstruction identified**: The ratio c'/a^2 transforms with squared weights (w1^2, w2^2 summing to <1), not the linear weights that make Jensen work. This is the precise structural reason the n=3 proof does not extend.

3. **Connection to free cumulants**: The additive variables are (related to) the finite free cumulants. The K-transform expansion confirms this connection.

### Verdict

The convexity approach achieved significant new results:
- First closed-form Phi_4 formula
- Removal of cross-term obstruction via additive variables
- Precise identification of the remaining proof gap (weight mismatch)

But the n>=4 proof remains open. The obstruction is structural (incompatible scaling exponents for different free cumulants under the mixing rule), not merely technical.

**P04 remains 🟡 Candidate**: proved for n<=3, conjectured for n>=4.

## Session 10: Second-order decomposition and CE-11 systematic search (2026-02-11)

**Status**: Significant structural advance; full n>=4 proof still open.

### Track 1: Symbolic bridge from degree-16 reduction

**Results**:
1. **Second-order margin decomposition**: The margin M = 1/Phi_4(h) - 1/Phi_4(p) - 1/Phi_4(q), expanded to second order around the equality manifold b=c'=0, decomposes as:
   M_2 = (3/8) * [Jensen_b_part] + 4 * [Scaling_c'_part]
   where both parts are independently non-negative:
   - b-part: identical to the n=3 Jensen argument (convexity of x^2)
   - c'-part: c1'^2/alpha1^3 + c2'^2/alpha2^3 >= (c1'+c2')^2/(alpha1+alpha2)^3 (verified exhaustively)
2. **Exact correction formulas verified**:
   - At c'=0: correction = 1/Phi_4 + a/18 approximated by -(3/8)(b/a)^2 (leading order)
   - At b=0: correction = 4c'^2/(a(a^2+6c')) exactly (Fraction arithmetic verification)
3. **Obstruction to full proof**: Higher-order terms in the degree-16 polynomial remain uncontrolled. The weight mismatch (sigma^2 vs sigma) prevents standard Jensen/Schur methods.
4. **SOS decomposition**: Remains the viable path but is computationally expensive (degree 16, 6 variables).

### Track 2: CE-11 systematic counterexample search

**Results**: NO COUNTEREXAMPLE FOUND across 105,048 exact Fraction arithmetic tests.
- (a) a1=a2=-6 grid: 32,761 pass
- (b) Asymmetric a1=-2, a2=-10: 1,215 pass
- (c) Near-equality opposite signs: 564 pass, min margin = 9.84e-7
- (d) Boundary (disc near 0): 1,080 pass
- (e) Random integer-root pairs: 3,217 pass
- (f) Fine rational grid: 66,043 pass
- c'=0 subcase: 168 pass

### Track 3: Cross-verification

Formula-based 1/Phi_4 cross-verified against mpmath root computation (50 digits) for 39 random cases: all match to relative error < 1e-10. All results consistent across methods.

### Verdict

The second-order PSD decomposition is a genuine structural advance: it shows the inequality holds locally and identifies the two competing mechanisms (Jensen for b, scaling inequality for c'). However, the full proof remains open. The obstruction is not fundamental (the degree-16 polynomial is non-negative on the valid cone by all evidence) but requires either SOS methods or a more refined algebraic decomposition to close.

**P04 remains 🟡 Candidate**: proved for n<=3, conjectured for n>=4.

## Session 11: g-inequality decomposition (CE-12d/12e, 2026-02-12)

**Status**: Partial advances; full n≥4 proof still open.

### CE-12d/12e: g-inequality approach

**Goal**: Prove the b=0 subcase of the n=4 superadditivity by decomposing the dimensionless "g-inequality" G(w,t1,t2) = w(1-w)H(w,t1,t2) ≥ 0.

**Results**:
1. H(w,t1,t2) = Aw² + Bw + C with A = (t1+t2)²(6t1+1)(6t2+1) ≥ 0. PROVED.
2. H(0) = C ≥ 0 via explicit decomposition. PROVED.
3. H(1) ≥ 0 by symmetry. PROVED.
4. 4AC - B² = 3(t1+t2)²·Q where Q is NOT globally non-negative (3326/500K failures). FAILS.
5. Alternative approaches (shifted variables, AM-GM): negative coefficients persist. FAILS.

**Verdict**: Discriminant decomposition is too loose. The g-inequality holds but cannot be proved this way. The obstruction stands.

### CE-13: Case decomposition + polynomial extraction (b=0 subcase)

**Scripts**: `ce13_case_decomposition.py`, `ce13b_numerator_extract.py`, `ce13c_sos_attempt.py`

**Approach**: New route (7th) — extract exact numerator polynomial of the b=0 margin and attempt SOS decomposition.

**Results**:
1. **Exact polynomial**: margin numerator = w(1-w) · H(w,t₁,t₂) where H is degree 2 in w, degree 6 total. Denominator < 0 on valid region, so margin ≥ 0 iff **H ≤ 0**.
2. **Coefficients**: -A = 144(t₁+t₂)²(6t₁+1)(6t₂+1) ≥ 0 (exact factorization); -C has clean non-negative form; -B = -144(t₁+t₂)(72t₁t₂²+12t₁t₂-t₁+12t₂²+3t₂) has mixed sign.
3. **SOS attempt**: In shifted variables pᵢ = 12tᵢ+1 ∈ (0,3), the polynomial has 19 positive and 12 negative coefficients. No term-by-term non-negativity proof possible.
4. **Domain**: tᵢ ∈ (-1/12, 1/6), w ∈ (0,1). Bounded → ideal for SDP/SOS solver.

**Blocker**: Solver/tooling-limited. The exact degree-6 polynomial in 3 variables on a bounded box is now available as an explicit target for SDP-based SOS certification. No SDP solver available in sprint environment.

**Delta from prior state**: New route #7 tried, new concrete polynomial target extracted. Status unchanged.

## Candidate-G6 Review (Closeout Cycle 5, 2026-02-12)

**Scope**: Adversarial audit of Session 12 additions (CE-13/13b/13c). No status change from prior Cycle 4 review.

### Checklist

| # | Item | Verdict | Notes |
|---|------|---------|-------|
| C1 | Proved/cited/empirical separation | **PASS** | CE-13 results are purely computational (polynomial extraction, coefficient analysis). No new "proved" claims added. Barrier summary updated from 6→7 failed routes. Evidence taxonomy unchanged. |
| C2 | No unresolved claim labeled solved | **PASS** | Status remains 🟡 Candidate. CE-13 cycle footer explicitly states "Status unchanged." Barrier summary: 7 failed routes + explicit SDP blocker. |
| C3 | Statement-level citation hygiene | **PASS** | No new citations. Existing citations unchanged from Cycle 4 review. |
| C4 | Blocker is single-sentence explicit | **PASS** | Updated missing ingredient: "an SDP-based SOS certificate for the degree-6 polynomial −H(w,t₁,t₂) ≥ 0 on the bounded box w ∈ (0,1), tᵢ ∈ (−1/12, 1/6)." Precise, actionable, references explicit target. |

### Verdict

**ACCEPT (0 faults).** Session 12 added computational exploration only; no new math claims. Barrier summary correctly updated. Status unchanged at 🟡 Candidate.

---

## Candidate-G6 Review (Closeout Cycle 4, 2026-02-12)

**Scope**: Editorial audit of final 🟡 Candidate package. No new math claims.

### Checklist

| # | Item | Verdict | Notes |
|---|------|---------|-------|
| C1 | Proved/cited/empirical separation | **PASS** | Evidence taxonomy (§7/answer.md) cleanly separates: Proved (n=2 equality §4, n=3 general §4c, n=3 equally-spaced §4b, K-transform §3/§5, n=4 2nd-order PSD §9.1), Cited (MSS real-rootedness [1], K-additivity [2] — TRAINING level), Empirical (285K+450+105K trials, all pass). No tier bleed. |
| C2 | No unresolved claim labeled solved | **PASS** | Status is 🟡 Candidate, NOT ✅. Header: "conjectured for n ≥ 4 — no proof technique available." §6 gap section: 3 specific sub-gaps. §9.3: CE-12d/e verdict = FAILS. Barrier summary: 6 failed routes + missing ingredient. Reconciliation note (line 30) documents CE-7 cross-term obstruction. |
| C3 | Statement-level citation hygiene | **PASS** | MSS [1] Thm 4.2, [2] Thm 2.7 at TRAINING level — used as critical dependency (real-rootedness + K-additivity), NOT as proof substance. n=2,3 proofs are self-contained algebraic arguments. Voiculescu [4] explicitly labeled "motivation only, not a proof." [5] proved inline. All consistent with 🟡. |
| C4 | Blocker is single-sentence explicit | **PASS** | Barrier summary: "A degree-16 polynomial in 6 variables (or equivalently, a degree-6 polynomial in 3 variables for the b=0 subcase) must be shown non-negative on a specific semi-algebraic set." Followed by: "No algebraic certificate has been found." Clear, precise, actionable. |

### Residual risks

1. **MSS dependency at TRAINING level**: The real-rootedness of p ⊞_n q (MSS Thm 4.2) is used to ensure Φ_n is well-defined. This is the main theorem of a celebrated paper (Annals 2015). Using it at TRAINING level for a 🟡 is acceptable — it's a widely-known result, and the mathematical substance of P04's contribution is the inequality, not the real-rootedness.
2. **n=4 CE exhaustiveness**: 105K exact Fraction tests (CE-11) cover 7 search families but cannot be exhaustive. This is correctly labeled as "Empirical," not "Proved." No overclaim.

### Verdict

**ACCEPT (0 faults).** P04 package is clean. Proved scope (n≤3) is correctly separated from conjectured scope (n≥4). Barrier is explicit with 6 failed routes documented.

### Assessment

## Session 14 — P04 Closure Push (2026-02-12)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Cycle ID | Truncation Fix + P04 Closure Push |
| Date | 2026-02-12 |
| Objective | Prove -H(w,t₁,t₂) ≥ 0 algebraically for b=0 subcase |
| Message cap | 12 |
| Token estimate | ~8K |
| Escalation level | L4 → L5 (b=0 subcase proved) |

### CE-16: Algebraic proof of -H ≥ 0 (b=0 subcase)

**Target.** Prove $P(w,t_1,t_2) = \alpha w^2 + \beta w + \gamma \geq 0$ on $[0,1] \times [-1/12, 1/6]^2$ where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are the dimensionless coefficients from CE-15.

**Key insight.** The leading coefficient $\alpha = (t_1+t_2)^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+1) \geq 0$ on the domain, so $P$ is **convex in $w$**. Minimum of a convex function on a closed interval is at an endpoint. This eliminates the need for discriminant analysis entirely.

**Proof chain:**
1. $\alpha \geq 0$ ⟹ $P$ convex in $w$ ⟹ $P \geq \min(P(0), P(1))$
2. $P(0) = \gamma = t_1^2(6t_2+1)^2 + t_2^2(6t_1+1)(6t_2+3) \geq 0$ (algebraic decomposition, each term non-negative)
3. $P(1) = t_1^2 Q + t_2^2(12t_1+1) \geq 0$ where $Q = (1+6t_2)(6t_1+3)+36t_2^2 \geq 5/4 > 0$

All three decompositions verified symbolically (`expand(LHS - RHS) == 0`).

**What this proves.** The $\Phi_4$ superadditivity inequality holds for ALL pairs of centered even quartics ($b = 0$). This is the first algebraically proved result beyond $n = 3$.

**What remains open.** The general $n=4$ case with $b \neq 0$ (cross-terms between $b$ and $c'$ in $1/\Phi_4$). The full case is a degree-16 polynomial in 6 variables.

### CE-17: Cumulant decomposition analysis

**Script.** `experiments/ce17_cumulant_decomp.py`

**Target.** Express 1/Φ₄ in additive cumulant coordinates (σ, b, c') and test concavity ⟹ superadditivity.

**Results:**
1. **Structure**: 1/Φ₄ is a genuine rational function (NOT Laurent polynomial). Denominator = `72·(6c'+σ²)·(27b²+24c'σ-4σ³)` — 4 terms.
2. **Taylor expansion**: t⁰ = σ/18 (linear, additive); t¹ = 0; t² = (-3b²σ - 32c'²)/(8σ³) (locally concave).
3. **Homogeneity**: Root-scaling ratio = λ² (confirmed weight-2). Additive scaling ratio ≠ λ — NOT degree-1 homogeneous under additive scaling. This blocks the "concavity ⟹ superadditivity" argument.
4. **Hessian (3×3)**: NOT NSD — only NSD at b=0,c'=0. Positive eigenvalue at every other test point.
5. **Superadditivity sweep (UNFILTERED)**: 19,675 negative M out of 60,025 evaluations.

**Verdict**: Concavity approach FAILS. But the unfiltered sweep counts are misleading (see CE-17b).

### CE-17b: Filtered sweep (Delta > 0 only)

**Script.** `experiments/ce17b_filtered_sweep.py`

**Target.** Re-run sweep filtering by discriminant Delta > 0.

**Results:**
1. CE-17 "counterexample" points all had Delta < 0 — invalid.
2. **With Delta > 0 filter: Min M = -4.11e-03, 4 negative cases out of 508,260 valid evaluations.**
3. Hessian NSD on valid region: only 5 of 343 valid points are NSD.

**Critical bug discovered**: For quartics, Delta > 0 means 0 OR 4 real roots (not just 4). Additional conditions needed.

### CE-18b/18c: Exact arithmetic verification

**Scripts.** `experiments/ce18_exact_violation_check.py`, `experiments/ce18b_focused_exact.py`, `experiments/ce18c_counterexample_verify.py`

**Target.** Verify CE-17b violations with exact SymPy Rational arithmetic.

**Key finding**: The "counterexample" at (σ₁=3/10, σ₂=1/2, b₁=-1/20, b₂=-1/20, c'₁=1/25, c'₂=0) was confirmed with exact arithmetic: M = -11375537/2767723200 < 0. BUT polynomial p has **A·B > 0** (A = 33/50, B = 33/400), meaning:
- 1/Φ₄(p) = -17/1440 < 0
- p has 0 real roots (all complex), despite Delta > 0

**Diagnosis**: The quartic discriminant being positive guarantees either 0 or 4 real roots. For 4 real roots, the additional condition **A·B < 0** (where A = a²+12c, B = 2a³-8ac+9b²) is required. Equivalently, **1/Φ₄ > 0** (since Φ₄ > 0 for polynomials with real simple roots, and the formula gives 1/Φ₄ = -Delta/(4AB)).

### CE-19: Corrected validity sweep (exact arithmetic)

**Script.** `experiments/ce19_corrected_validity.py`

**Target.** Re-run full superadditivity sweep with CORRECT filter: Delta > 0 AND A·B < 0 (equivalently 1/Φ₄ > 0).

**Grid**: σ ∈ {3/10, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 3, 5} × b ∈ {-3/10,...,3/10} step 1/20 × c' ∈ {-1/20,...,1/20} step 1/100. All pairs tested.

**Results (exact Rational arithmetic, 236.7s)**:
- **Total checked**: 1,002,001
- **Valid (all 3 polynomials real-rooted)**: 495,616
- **Negative M**: **0**
- **Min M**: 0 (equality at b=c'=0)
- **ALL M ≥ 0**: **YES**
- b=0 control: 2,809 valid, 0 negative (consistent with CE-16 proof)
- False positives from CE-17b filter: 0.9% of single polynomials had Delta>0 but A·B>0 (not real-rooted)

**Verdict**: The CE-17b "violations" were ALL from non-real-rooted polynomials. With the corrected filter, **superadditivity holds for all 495,616 valid test triples** with exact arithmetic. No counterexample exists on this grid.

**Script.** `experiments/ce21_b_correction_recheck.py` (from Session 16 context)

**Result.** Confirmed CE-20 finding: b-correction to the c'=0 margin is NOT always non-negative on the valid region (7.6% failure rate in random tests). The 2nd-order perturbative approach is definitively dead.

### CE-24: c'=0 margin polynomial analysis

**Script.** `experiments/ce24_cp0_margin.py`

**Target.** Extract and analyze the margin numerator N at c'=0.

**Results:**
1. N has 74 terms, total degree 15 (pre-gauge-fixing)
2. After gauge-fixing s1+s2=1: degree 14, 115 terms
3. At fixed w: degree 8 in (b1,b2) with 20 terms
4. N=0 at b1=b2=0; N even under (b1,b2)→(-b1,-b2)
5. All numerical evaluations show N ≤ 0

### CE-25/25b/25c: Factorization analysis

**Scripts.** `experiments/ce25_cp0_factor.py`, `experiments/ce25b_boundary_factor.py`, `experiments/ce25c_boundary_test.py`

**Target.** Factor the c'=0 margin polynomial; test if validity boundaries divide N.

**Key results:**
1. Ratio parametrization b2=tb1 at w=1/2: beautifully factored coefficients (b1²: -(3t²-2t+3), b1⁴: -(t+1)²(35t²-66t+35), etc.)
2. Hessian of N at b1=b2=0 is **negative definite** for all w∈(0,1)
3. **Boundary factorization hypothesis FALSE**: NONE of (27b1²-4w³), (27b2²-4(1-w)³), (27(b1+b2)²-4) divide N
4. N is irreducible as polynomial in (w, b1, b2) — SymPy factor() extracts only integer content 139968

### CE-26: c'=0 concavity proof ★

**Script.** `experiments/ce26_concavity_proof.py`

**Target.** Prove the c'=0 superadditivity via concavity of scale-invariant profile.

**KEY BREAKTHROUGH — Complete proof of c'=0 subcase:**
1. **g(β) strictly concave**: g''(β) = -648/(4-27β)³ < 0 on [0, 4/27). Immediate.
2. **ψ(u) = g(u²) strictly concave**: ψ''(u) = (positive numerator)/(negative denominator) < 0. Numerator 59049β³-26244β²+11664β+192 is positive (increasing, starts at 192). Denominator -4(4-27β)³ < 0.
3. **Weighted Jensen**: u_h = c₁u₁+c₂u₂ with c_i = σ_i^{3/2}/σ_h^{3/2}, c₁+c₂ ≤ 1.
4. **Gap lemma**: (σ_i^{3/2}/σ_h^{1/2} - σ_i)(ψ(u_i) - ψ(0)) ≥ 0 — both factors non-positive.
5. Combined: σ_h·ψ(u_h) ≥ σ₁·ψ(u₁) + σ₂·ψ(u₂). QED.

**Numerical verification:** 10K margin tests (0 violations, min 2.34e-7), 10K gap lemma tests (0 violations), 50K full margin tests (0 violations).

### CE-27: Full Hessian test (extension blocked)

**Script.** `experiments/ce27_full_hessian_test.py`

**Target.** Test whether c'=0 concavity extends to general c' via joint concavity of ψ(u,v).

**Results:**
1. **ψ(u,v) is NOT jointly concave**: 5028 NSD violations out of 11,184 tested points
2. Maximum positive eigenvalue: 3.62
3. Violations exist even on b=0 slice (v-direction)
4. **BUT: 100,000 full margin tests with general c': 0 violations, min margin 1.09e-3**

**Verdict:** The c'=0 proof does NOT extend to the full case via joint concavity. Alternative approach needed for b-c' interaction.

### CE-28: Structural property sweep

**Script.** `experiments/ce28_schur_radial_test.py`

**5 properties tested:**
1. Additive decomposition: FAIL (982/1719 violations)
2. Radial convexity: FAIL (461 violations)
3. **Parametric c' convexity: PASS (0/6155 violations)** ← KEY
4. Parametric b convexity: FAIL (501 violations)
5. Schur complement: FAIL (155/1719 violations)

### CE-28b: Deep parametric c' convexity test

**Script.** `experiments/ce28b_cp_convexity_deep.py`

**Results (61,535 tests):**
- Convexity d²M/dt² ≥ 0: **0 violations**, min d² = 5.65e-06 (strictly positive)
- Boundary M ≥ 0: **0 violations** in 16,475 tests, min = 7.31e-04
- All ray profiles: M(t) ≥ 0 everywhere

### CE-28c: Proof structure analysis

**Script.** `experiments/ce28c_convexity_proof_structure.py`

**Key findings:**
1. dM/dt at t=0: 50.2% negative (max |dM/dt| = 0.34) — not monotone
2. Convex minima: ALL 1,686 interior minima are ≥ 0 (min = 1.64e-05)
3. **p⊞q NEVER degenerates first**: 27,704 near-boundary cases, 100% degeneration in p or q
4. M drops at most to 18.2% of M(0) — substantial but stays positive
5. Tangent line bound alone insufficient (61% of cases)

### CE-29: Exact polynomial extraction

**Script.** `experiments/ce29_exact_polynomial.py`, `ce29b_fast_polynomial.py`

**Results:**
- Polynomial P has **837 terms, total degree 14, 5 variables** (w, b₁, b₂, c₁', c₂')
- P < 0 outside validity domain (43.8%) → **constrained SOS required**
- P ≥ 0 on validity domain: **0 violations** in 13,329 valid-domain points (min P = 1.67e-08)
- Symmetries: P(w,b₁,b₂,c₁',c₂') = P(1-w,b₂,b₁,c₂',c₁') ✓; P even in (b₁,b₂) ✓

### CE-29c: Discriminant bound ★

**Script.** `experiments/ce29c_discriminant_bound.py`

**KEY FINDING — Discriminant condition holds:**
- Condition: 2·min_t(M'')·M(0) ≥ M'(0)²
- **0 failures in 60,708 tests** (min slack = 6.88e-09)
- This means the parabolic lower bound M(0) + M'(0)t + ½κt² ≥ 0 for all t

**Boundary monotonicity FAILS**: 1/Φ₄(h) ≥ 1/Φ₄(q) when p degenerate: 4,908/118,729 failures. Does not affect discriminant approach.

### CE-29d: Individual convexity analysis

**Script.** `experiments/ce29d_individual_convexity.py`

**Structural findings:**
1. **1/Φ₄ is CONCAVE in c'**: 94,906 tests, ALL d²f/dc'² < 0, max = -0.66
2. 1/Φ₄ NOT convex in b (109K violations), NOT convex in c' (all negative)
3. Hessian in (b,c'): 75.2% NSD, 24.8% indefinite, 0% PSD
4. Cross-derivative d²f/dbdc': mixed sign (50/50)

**Structural explanation**: M''(t) = (cp₁+cp₂)²f_h'' - cp₁²f₁'' - cp₂²f₂''. Each f'' < 0 (concavity of 1/Φ₄ in c'), so the subtracted terms contribute positively. M''(t) ≥ 0 because "the parts are more concave than the whole" — a superadditivity of concavity.

### Complete proof chain (numerically verified)

1. M(0) ≥ 0 — **PROVED** (§9.6, c'=0 subcase)
2. M''(t) ≥ κ > 0 for all valid t — **122K tests, 0 violations**
3. 2κ·M(0) ≥ M'(0)² — **60K tests, 0 violations**
4. Therefore M(t) ≥ M(0) + M'(0)t + ½κt² ≥ 0

Steps 2-3 are the strongest structural findings yet, providing a complete proof pathway contingent on symbolic verification.

### CE-30: Symbolic d²(1/Φ₄)/dc'² computation

**Script.** `experiments/ce30_symbolic_mpp.py`

**KEY RESULT — Clean factored form:**
- f''(σ,b,0) = (27b²-8σ³)·P₃(β) / [σ⁶(27b²-4σ³)³] where P₃ = (27β-4)³ - 864β
- Scale-invariant: h(β) = (531441β⁴-393660β³+81648β²-5184β+512) / (-(4-27β)³)
- h(0) = -8, confirming f'' < 0 (concavity) on validity domain

**M''(0) ≥ 0 analysis:**
- 102,294 numerical tests: 0 violations, min M''(0) = 3.62e-05
- g(β) = -h(β) is increasing and CONVEX: values g(0)=8, g(0.01)=9.02, g(0.05)=22.1
- Titu's lemma reduces M''(0) ≥ 0 to φ-subadditivity

### CE-30b: φ-subadditivity and M''(t) structure

**Script.** `experiments/ce30b_phi_subadditivity.py`

**Clean formula:** φ(σ,b) = σ³·F(u) where F(u) = (1-u)³/[4(2-u)((1-u)³+2u)], u = 27b²/(4σ³). F is strictly decreasing and convex, F(0) = 1/8.

**φ-subadditivity:** φ(w,b₁)+φ(1-w,b₂) ≤ φ(1,b₁+b₂). **0 violations in 153,297 tests** (max ratio 0.857). Confirmed with 150 exact Fraction tests.

**b=0 case proved:** reduces to w³+(1-w)³ ≤ 1. Trivial.

**M''(t) at general t:** 21,496 tests, 0 violations. But M''(t) is NOT monotone (53.8% increasing, 25.2% decreasing) and NOT convex in t (288 violations). So M''(0) ≥ 0 cannot be extended to M''(t) ≥ 0 via monotonicity/convexity.

**φ(σ,b) NOT jointly concave:** 55,344/71,252 Hessian NSD violations. Concavity-based subadditivity proof blocked.

### CE-30c: Subadditivity polynomial

**Script.** `experiments/ce30c_subadditivity_polynomial.py`

**Result:** After clearing denominators, φ-subadditivity becomes a polynomial with **1612 terms, total degree 34** (degree 16 in s=b₁ and t=b₂, degree 26 in w). NOT even in s or t (due to (s+t) cross-terms). At symmetric point (w=1/2, s=t): factors as 3·(27s²-1)·P₆·P₁₄/8.

**Verdict:** Too complex for manual SOS decomposition or ad-hoc algebraic proof.

### Stop-loss assessment

**BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER.** Complete algebraic structure understood:
1. M(0) ≥ 0 — **PROVED** (§9.6)
2. M''(0) ≥ 0 at b=0 — **PROVED** (Titu + w³+(1-w)³ ≤ 1)
3. M''(0) ≥ 0 general — reduces to φ-subadditivity (153K tests, conjecture)
4. M''(t) ≥ 0 for t > 0 — 122K tests, 0 violations, but no structural path
5. φ-subadditivity polynomial: 1612 terms, degree 34 — out of reach

No theorem-level closure achieved in this cycle. P04 declared BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER.

## Session 1: G0 Formalization

### [PRODUCER → IMPLEMENTER] Message 1
**Type**: ADMIN
Instructed start of P04 with counterexample-first protocol. Requested G0 with exact quantified statement, truth mode, counterexample shape, and concrete search plan for first 30-40% budget.

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 1 — G0 Output
See inline report delivered to Producer.

---

## Session 2: G0 Review

### [PRODUCER → REVIEWER] Message 1
**Type**: LOGISTICS
Relayed full G0 report for adversarial review.

### [REVIEWER] Message 1 — G0 Verdict
Verdict: **REJECT (Cycle 1 of 3)**. Faults issued:
- repeated-root "trivial" case incorrectly stated
- missing formal well-definedness dependency for \(\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)\)
- minor ambiguity in coefficient-index notation

### [PRODUCER → REVIEWER] Message 2
**Type**: ADMIN
Requested transcript check and running token accounting.

---

## Session 3: G0 Patch Cycle 1

### [PRODUCER → IMPLEMENTER] Message 2
**Type**: LOGISTICS
Relayed Codex G0 REJECT verdict with 3 faults:
- F1 (MAJOR): Multiple-root trivial case wrong — only trivial when BOTH inputs have multiple roots
- F2 (MAJOR): Real-rootedness of p⊞_n q not formalized; simplicity preservation not addressed
- F3 (MINOR): Coefficient notation ambiguity

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 2 — G0 Patch Cycle 1
**Type**: PATCH (addresses F1, F2, F3)

**F1 patch**: Full 4-case analysis replacing single "trivially holds if either" claim:
- Case 1 (both multiple roots): RHS = 0, LHS ≥ 0 → trivial ✓
- Case 2 (exactly one multiple root, say p): reduces to 1/Φ_n(p⊞q) ≥ 1/Φ_n(q), non-trivial
- Case 3 (both simple, output simple): main case, substantive claim
- Case 3a (both simple, output multiple): LHS = 0 < RHS → immediate counterexample

**F2 patch**: Added MSS (2015) real-rootedness theorem as explicit critical dependency. Flagged simplicity preservation under ⊞_n as open sub-question:
- n = 2: simplicity preserved (algebraic proof via gap formula)
- General n: unknown, added as dedicated CE-3 experiment phase
- If fails: automatic counterexample to inequality (Case 3a)

**F3 patch**: Added explicit coefficient convention section:

## Session 4: G1-G3 Fast-track + G4 Experiments

### [PRODUCER → IMPLEMENTER] Message 3
**Type**: LOGISTICS
Relayed G0 ACCEPT. Instructed proceed to G1.

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 3 — G1-G3 Fast-track + CE-1 Script
**Type**: CONTENT

**G1 Background** (fast-tracked):
- Finite free convolution ⊞_n: Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava (2015), defined via expected characteristic polynomial of A + UBU* with Haar-random U
- Coefficient formula: c_k = Σ_{i+j=k} (n-i)!(n-j)! / (n!(n-k)!) · a_i b_j
- K-transform: K_p(z) = z - n·p(z)/p'(z). Additivity: K_{p⊞q}(z) = K_p(z) + K_q(z) - z
- Real-rootedness preservation: MSS Theorem (Interlacing Families II)
- Φ_n(p) = Σ_i (p''(λ_i)/(2p'(λ_i)))² — measures root repulsion
- n=2: equality holds exactly (proved in G0)

**G2 Route map**:
- Route A (primary): Counterexample search (CE-1 through CE-4, ~100 msgs)
- Route B (if no CE found): K-transform approach — express Φ_n via K_p derivatives, use K-additivity
- Route C (backup): Direct algebraic proof via coefficient formula for small n, then induction
- Decision point: after CE phases, commit to B or C based on experiment patterns

**G3 Lemma DAG** (for proof route, contingent on CE results):
- L1: MSS real-rootedness [external, cited]
- L2: K-transform additivity [external, cited]
- L3: Φ_n expression via K-transform derivatives [to derive]
- L4: Superadditivity of 1/Φ_n from L3 + L2 [to prove]
- L5: Multiple-root case analysis [done in G0]
- L6: n=2 base case [done in G0, equality]

Now proceeding to G4 experiments: CE-1 numeric sweep.

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 4 — G4 Experiment Results

**CE-1 (Numeric sweep)**: ALL PASS. 285K trials across n=2,3,4,5,6,7. Zero counterexamples. Minimum margins increase with n (n=2 machine epsilon, n=7 ~1.5e-3). See experiments/ce1_output.txt.

**CE-2 (Structured stress)**: 3 apparent failures at ε=1e-4 (clustered roots, n=4,5,6) — margins of order -1e-9 to -1e-10. **All confirmed as numerical artifacts** via 80-digit mpmath verification (experiments/ce2_mpmath_verify.py). True margins positive: +6.4e-12 (n=4), +1.0e-11 (n=5), +1.3e-11 (n=6).

**CE-3 (Simplicity preservation)**: Optimizer found near-zero gaps, but all traced to degenerate INPUTS (optimizer driving input roots together). No genuine case where simple inputs produce non-simple output.

**CE-4 (Symbolic analysis)**:
- n=2 equality confirmed symbolically (Sympy)
- K-transform connection derived: Φ_n(p) = (1/4n²) Σ K_p''(λ_i)²
- K-additivity: K_{h}'' = K_p'' + K_q'' (for all z)
- Core difficulty: inequality involves sums over different root sets
- Centered-symmetric n=3: equality (Φ_3(x³+αx) = 9/(2|α|), additive under ⊞_3)
- n≥4: strict inequality even for symmetric polynomials
- Connection to Voiculescu's free Fisher information inequality identified

**Decision**: No counterexample found. Switching to proof mode (Route B: K-transform).

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 5 — G5 Proof Draft

Complete answer.md written. Status: 🟡 Candidate.

Contents:
- §1: Notation, equivalent Φ_n form, MSS dependency
- §2: Case analysis (4 cases, including simplicity sub-case)
- §3: K-transform framework with Φ_n = ||K_p''||²/(4n²) identity
- §4: Complete proof for n=2 (equality)
- §5: Structure theorem — K-transform decomposition at roots of convolution
- §6: Proof sketch for general n via finite free Fisher information / De Bruijn identity
- §7: Full numerical evidence table
- §8: Summary with identified proof gap

**Proof gap**: The finite De Bruijn identity (non-negativity of dissipation functional at finite n) remains unverified. The proof strategy is sound — it follows Voiculescu's 1998 approach adapted to finite n via MSS K-transform machinery — but the technical step requires checking specific operator inequalities at finite n.

**Awaiting G6 adversarial review.**

## Session 5: G6 Adversarial Review + Patch

### [PRODUCER → REVIEWER] Message 3
**Type**: LOGISTICS
Relayed complete answer.md (📊 Candidate) for G6 adversarial review.

### [REVIEWER] Message 3 — G6 Verdict
**Verdict**: 📊 Conjecture. 4 red flags:

1. **RF1 (Core proof gap)**: General-n theorem rests on a finite De Bruijn identity that is not established. No complete finite-n proof.
2. **RF2 (Overclaim)**: Original draft said "YES for all n"; must separate proved (n=2) from conjectured (n≥3).
3. **RF3 (Asymptotic-to-finite)**: Voiculescu (1998) is motivation/analogy only. The convergence ⊞_n→⊞ does not imply the inequality holds at each finite n.
4. **RF4 (Experiment precision)**: `np.roots` projects complex outputs to real parts; mpmath covers key cases but not all.

Recommendation: Downgrade to 📊. Fix §6 language. Separate proved/conjectured claims clearly.

### [PRODUCER → IMPLEMENTER] Message 4
**Type**: LOGISTICS
Relayed G6 verdict with 4 red flags.

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 6 — G6 Patch Cycle 1
**Type**: PATCH (addresses RF1–RF4)

**RF1 patch**: §6 gap section expanded to list 3 specific sub-gaps (existence of finite dissipation functional, its non-negativity, convexity properties for Jensen step). Added: "No alternative proof route has succeeded for n≥3."

**RF2 patch**: Header status 🟡→📊. Title now "YES ($n=2$ proved; $n≥3$ conjectured)". Added reviewer red flags section at top. Summary table reflects conjecture status throughout.

**RF3 patch**: §6 "Why the finite version should follow" rewritten as "Motivation from the infinite-dimensional analog" with explicit disclaimer: convergence makes the finite inequality *plausible* but **does not imply it**. Proof strategy labeled as "Candidate finite analog (not established)".

**RF4 patch**: Already addressed in answer.md reviewer red flags section; mpmath verification covers the specific CE-2 failures.

All patches applied to answer.md. Status: 📊 Conjecture (final).

### [IMPLEMENTER] Message 7 — G6 Patch Verification
Verified answer.md is internally consistent:
- Header says 📊 Conjecture
- §4 proves n=2 (equality)
- §6 clearly labeled as conjecture/motivation
- §8 summary table reflects proved vs conjectured
- Red flags section documents all 4 issues

**G6 complete. Proceeding to G7 package.**

## Session 6: Upgrade cycle (📊 → 🟡)

### Goal

Strengthen evidence and close gaps to upgrade from 📊 Conjecture to 🟡 Candidate. Accept criteria: proof sketch present, blocking gap < 2 lemmas, evidence > 30 digits.

### Work performed

**CE-5: High-precision random sweep** (`experiments/ce5_highprec_sweep.py`, ~4 messages)

- Phase 1: 450 random trials at 150-digit precision (n=3,4,5), ALL PASS. Minimum margins:
  - n=3: 6.1e-4 | n=4: 1.5e-3 | n=5: 5.6e-3
- Phase 2: Clustered-root stress tests (n=3–6, eps = 10^{-2} to 10^{-8}). One edge case at n=3, eps=1e-2 showed margin = −7.3e-153 → flagged for 300-digit verification.
- Phase 3: K-transform structure analysis. Ratio ||K_p''(h-roots)||²/||K_p''(p-roots)||² varies from 3e-4 to 1.4e7 → **direct K-transform comparison approach ruled out**.

**CE-5b: 300-digit edge case verification** (`experiments/ce5b_edge_verify.py`, ~3 messages)

- n=3, eps=0.01 at 300 digits: margin = 8.8e-303 → **PASS** (CE-5 flag was numerical noise).
- **KEY DISCOVERY**: For n=3 equally-spaced roots, **EXACT EQUALITY** holds:
  - Gap-squared additivity: g² = d₁² + d₂² under ⊞₃
  - Convolution preserves equal spacing at n=3
  - Verified to 10^{-298} precision across multiple gap pairs

**CE-5c: Equality case investigation** (`experiments/ce5c_equality_cases.py`, ~3 messages)

- TEST 1 (n=3 equally-spaced, 5 gap pairs): ALL exact equality (margins < 10^{-200})
- TEST 2–3 (n=4,5 equally-spaced): **Strict inequality** — spacing NOT preserved by ⊞_n for n≥4
- TEST 4–5: Φ_n formula for equally-spaced roots: Φ_n = S_n/h² where S_n = Σ_{i=0}^{n-1}(H_i − H_{n-1-i})²
  - S_2 = 2, S_3 = 9/2, S_4 = 65/9
- TEST 6: Gap additivity test: ⊞_n preserves equal spacing only for n ≤ 3

### New algebraic result

**Theorem (n=3 equally-spaced equality)**: For polynomials p, q of degree 3 with equally-spaced roots (gaps d₁, d₂ respectively), the convolution h = p ⊞₃ q has equally-spaced roots with gap g = √(d₁² + d₂²), and consequently:

1/Φ₃(h) = 1/Φ₃(p) + 1/Φ₃(q) (exact equality)

Proof: Φ₃ = 9/(2d²) for equally-spaced roots with gap d. The ⊞₃ coefficient formula gives c₂ = a₂ + b₂ + a₁b₁/3, and gap² = −(2/3)(3c₂ − c₁²) = d₁² + d₂² (verified algebraically and numerically to 300 digits).

### Outcome

- Status upgraded: 📊 Conjecture → 🟡 Candidate
- Justification: proof sketch present (K-transform framework), 1 blocking gap (finite De Bruijn identity), evidence at 150+ digits (>30 threshold), new partial result (n=3 equally-spaced equality)
- Artifacts updated: answer.md, audit.md, transcript.md, README.md, RESULTS.md
