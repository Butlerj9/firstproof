# Claude Research Prompt — P05 Only

You are Claude in RESEARCH MODE focusing ONLY on P05.

Objective:
Close P05 if possible; otherwise produce a frontier certificate with fully documented escalation.

Research-mode escalation policy:
1) Exhaust non-contaminating routes first (local derivation, existing artifacts, experiments, controlled scouts).
2) If still blocked, you MAY use potentially contaminating references as a last resort.
3) Any potentially contaminating source MUST be documented in your response and artifacts with:
   - URL / identifier
   - access date/time (UTC)
   - why escalation was necessary
   - exact claim extracted (statement-level)
   - contamination risk rating (LOW/MED/HIGH)
   - whether incorporated, quarantined, or rejected
4) Prefer statement extraction over solution text. Never paste or mirror full external proofs.
5) If direct-solution exposure occurs, quarantine that thread and continue with a clean derivation path.

Current blocker snapshot:
- 8 theorems proved + frontier theorem.
- Z/4 smallest Class II case CLOSED (Theorem 8) using geometric triviality + isotropy separation.
- Remaining frontier: non-cyclic Class II "if" direction only.
- New smallest open case: Z/2 × Z/2 with intermediate O.
- Core unresolved component: global lifting/compatibility mechanism across subgroup lattices with width > 1.

Protocol:
1) Failure map.
2) >=12 new approach families (>=4 cross-domain).
3) Novelty gate.
4) Top 3 with bridge lemma + kill-test + proof skeleton.
5) Verdict: CLOSEABLE_NOW or BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER.
6) 48-hour lane plan.

Output:
A) Lane Verdict Table
B) Actionable Plan
C) Escalation & Contamination Log
