        "reasoning": "We need to output JSON with required fields. Provide candidate formal definitions: uniform lattice, real semisimple Lie group, 2-torsion, compact manifold, fundamental group, universal cover, rationally acyclic (i.e., reduced homology with Q coefficients zero). Provide confidence levels and source candidates (e.g., Borel's \"Linear Algebraic Groups\", Raghunathan's \"Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups\", Bridson\u2013Haefliger \"Metric Spaces of Non-Positive Curvature\", etc.)\n\nStatement targets: existence of compact aspherical manifold with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. Likely references: Borel-Serre compactification, Borel's \"Stable real cohomology of arithmetic groups\", Davis-Januszkiewicz \"Hyperbolization of polyhedra\", Gromov's \"Aspherical manifolds with exotic universal covers\", etc. Also \"Farrell\u2013Jones conjecture\" maybe. Provide likely source and label/section.\n\nMinimal dependency set: definitions of uniform lattice, rationally acyclic, etc., plus theorem about existence of aspherical manifolds with given lattice (e.g., Borel-Serre, Mostow rigidity). Also need concept of \"torsion-free finite index subgroup\" to get manifold.\n\nAmbiguity flags: \"2-torsion\" meaning elements of order 2 in Gamma; whether Gamma itself has 2-torsion or just contains 2-torsion? Also \"rationally acyclic universal cover\" meaning H_i(~M;Q)=0 for i>0.\n\nDo_not_assume: that Gamma is torsion-free; that rational acyclicity implies contractibility; that compactness implies aspherical.\n\nLet's craft JSON."
