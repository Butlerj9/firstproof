You are assisting a math workflow under strict contamination controls.
Task: Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.
Do NOT provide proof ideas, proof sketches, route strategies, or attempt to answer the problem.
If uncertain, mark uncertainty explicitly.

Output STRICT JSON with keys:
- problem_id
- core_definitions: [{term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates:[...]}]
- statement_targets: [{needed_statement, likely_source, likely_label_or_section, confidence}]
- minimal_dependency_set: [{item, why_critical, confidence}]
- ambiguity_flags: [string]
- do_not_assume: [string]

Problem P05 context:
- Finite group G.
- Incomplete transfer system O associated to an N∞ operad.
- Need: define O-adapted slice filtration on G-equivariant stable category.
- Need: characterize O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum via geometric fixed points.
Need clean formal definitions and citation targets only.
