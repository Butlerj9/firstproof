This means I should only provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets. I must NOT provide proof ideas, proof sketches, route strategies, or attempt to answer the problem.\n\nThe problem context is:\n- Finite group G\n- Incomplete transfer system O associated to an N\u221e operad\n- Need: define O-adapted slice filtration on G-equivariant stable category\n- Need: characterize O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum via geometric fixed points\n\nI need to output strict JSON with specific keys:\n- problem_id\n- core_definitions\n- statement_targets\n- minimal_dependency_set\n- ambiguity_flags\n- do_not_assume\n\nLet me think about what definitions and sources are needed here:\n\n1. **Incomplete transfer system / N\u221e operad**: \n   - Key sources: Blumberg-Hill \"Operadic multiplications in equivariant spectra, values and norms\" (or similar titles)\n   - Need definition of transfer system, incomplete version, association to N\u221e operads\n\n2. **O-adapted slice filtration**:\n   - The ordinary slice filtration is due to Dugger, or maybe Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel\n   - For \"O-adapted\" or \"generalized\" slice filtrations, likely sources: Hill-Yarnall \"A new formulation of the equivariant slice filtration\", or possibly work by Bachmann-Hoyois, or Wilson\n   - The O-adapted version should be related to restricting which slices appear based on the transfer system O\n\n3. **Slice connectivity**:\n   - Need the definition of slice connectivity (usually denoted \u2265 n or something similar)\n   - The characterization via geometric fixed points is a key result\n\n4. **Geometric fixed points**:\n   - Standard reference: Mandell-May \"Equivariant orthogonal spectra and S-modules\", or Schwede \"Global homotopy theory\", or Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel\n\n5. **G-equivariant stable category**:\n   - Need to specify which model: orthogonal G-spectra (Mandell-May), or G-spectra (Lewis-May-Steinberger)\n\nKey sources to consider:\n- Blumberg-Hill: Foundations of N\u221e operads and transfer systems\n- Hill-Yarnall: Slice filtration formulations\n- Ullman: Related work on extensions\n- Bachmann-Hoyois: Norms and slices?\n- Wilson: Some work on slice filtrations\n\nFor \"O-adapted slice filtration\", I believe this is discussed in work by Hill-Yarnall or possibly by Blumberg-Hill. Actually, I think the \"O-slice filtration\" appears in work relating to parametrized homotopy theory or possibly in the context of \"genuine\" vs \"naive\" versions controlled by the operad.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. The user mentions \"O-adapted slice filtration\" and \"O-slice connectivity\". This sounds like it's from recent literature on slice filtrations adapted to incomplete Tambara functors or similar.\n\nLet me think about specific papers:\n- \"The slice filtration and spectral Mackey functors\" by Hill-Yarnall?\n- \"Incomplete Tambara functors\" by Blumberg-Hill?\n- \"Parametrized higher category theory\" by Barwick-Dotto-Glasman-Nardin-Shah? (This deals with O-monoidal structures)\n\nActually, I think the key reference for O-adapted slice filtration is:\n- Hill, M.A. and Yarnall, C. \"A new formulation of the equivariant slice filtration\" (JoU 2017?)\n\nBut for the O-adapted version specifically (where O is a transfer system), this might be in:\n- \"Equivariant chromatic localizations and commutativity\" by Hacohen-Sanadze?\n- Or \"The homotopy groups of the K-theory of the sphere spectrum\" by... no.\n\nLet me reconsider. The problem mentions \"Incomplete transfer system O associated to an N\u221e operad\". This is classic Blumberg-Hill. The slice filtration adapted to this might be in:\n- \"On the Blumberg-Hill conjecture\" by others?\n- Or in work by Zou, Sanadze, etc.\n\nActually, a crucial reference might be:\n- \"The slice filtration for C_p^n\" or similar, but that's specific.\n\nFor the characterization of slice connectivity via geometric fixed points, the classical reference is:\n- Hill, Hopkins, Ravenel \"The Arf-Kervaire invariant problem in algebraic topology: introduction\"\n- Or more precisely: \"The slice spectral sequence for certain RO(G)-graded suspensions\"\n\nBut for O-slice connectivity, I need the generalization.\n\nLet me try to be precise about what should be in the JSON:\n\ncore_definitions:\n1. Transfer system (incomplete): Definition from Blumberg-Hill\n2. N\u221e operad: Definition from Blumberg-Hill\n3. O-adapted slice filtration: This needs a candidate definition. It likely restricts the slice cells to those permitted by the transfer system O.\n4. O-slice connectivity: The condition on a spectrum\n5. Geometric fixed points: Standard definition \u03a6^H\n6. The category of G-spectra: Should specify the model\n\nstatement_targets:\n1. The definition/construction of O-slice filtration\n2. The characterization theorem connecting O-slice connectivity to geometric fixed points connectivity\n\nminimal_dependency_set:\n- The specific construction of slice filtration from Hill-Yarnall or equivalent\n- The relationship between transfer systems and the partial order of subgroups (induction/restriction restrictions)\n- Geometric fixed points detection theorems\n\nambiguity_flags:\n- Which model of G-spectra (orthogonal vs symmetric vs model-independent)\n- Whether O is an indexing system or transfer system (these are equivalent but different presentations)\n- The specific version of \"O-adapted\" (there might be multiple constructions)\n\ndo_not_assume:\n- That the ordinary slice filtration is known to the user in detail\n- Specific bounds or formulas for slice towers\n- That O is complete (this would trivialize the problem)\n\nLet me construct the JSON carefully:\n\nproblem_id: \"P05\"\n\ncore_definitions:\n- term: \"transfer system (incomplete)\"\n  formal_definition_candidate: \"A subcategory O of the category of finite G-sets (or subgroups) closed under pullbacks along restriction maps, containing all isomorphisms, and satisfying certain closure properties encoding which transfer maps are allowed; equivalently, a partial order on Sub(G) closed under conjugation and restriction\"\n  confidence: \"high\"\n  source_candidates: [\"Blumberg-Hill, 'Operadic multiplications in equivariant spectra, values and norms', Def 3.7 or similar\", \"Rubin, 'Combinatorial N\u221e operads', Def 2.1\"]\n\n- term: \"N\u221e operad\"\n  formal_definition_candidate: \"An operad in G-spaces whose underlying non-equivariant operad is E\u221e, and whose fixed points O(n)^H are contractible or empty, with the collection of admissible sets forming a transfer system\"\n  confidence: \"high\"\n  source_candidates: [\"Blumberg-Hill, arXiv:1309.1750, Def 3.8\", \"Blumberg-Hill, 'G-symmetric monoidal categories...', Def 4.6\"]\n\n- term: \"O-adapted slice filtration\"\n  formal_definition_candidate: \"A filtration of the G-equivariant stable homotopy category indexed by RO(G) (or a variant) where the slice spheres are restricted to"
