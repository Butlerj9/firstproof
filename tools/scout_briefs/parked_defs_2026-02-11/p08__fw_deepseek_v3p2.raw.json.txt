        "content": "We are given a problem about a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4 with all faces Lagrangian and 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The question is whether K admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets only. We are not to provide proof ideas or attempt to answer the problem.\n\nWe need to output strict JSON with keys: problem_id, core_definitions, statement_targets, minimal_dependency_set, ambiguity_flags, do_not_assume.\n\nFirst, identify the problem_id. It is given as \"Problem P08 context\", so we can set problem_id: \"P08\".\n\nNow, we need to provide core_definitions. We need to define terms that are central to the problem. The terms include:\n- Polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4.\n- Lagrangian faces.\n- 4 faces meeting at each vertex.\n- Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing.\n- K_t -> K (smoothing).\n\nWe need to provide formal definition candidates, confidence, and source candidates (likely references).\n\nWe also need statement_targets: likely statements from literature that are needed, e.g., definitions, theorems about Lagrangian smoothing, Hamiltonian isotopy, etc.\n\nMinimal_dependency_set: items that are critical to understand the problem, e.g., definitions of Lagrangian submanifolds, Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, etc.\n\nAmbiguity_flags: any ambiguities in the problem statement.\n\nDo_not_assume: things we should not assume.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nWe have a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4. \"Polyhedral\" likely means it is a piecewise linear surface made of polygons (faces). \"Lagrangian\" means each face is a Lagrangian subspace or a Lagrangian submanifold? Actually, it says \"all faces Lagrangian\", so each face is a Lagrangian submanifold (or perhaps a linear Lagrangian subspace if the faces are flat). Since it is a polyhedral surface, the faces are likely flat polygons that are Lagrangian subspaces (i.e., linear subspaces that are Lagrangian with respect to the symplectic form). In R^4 with the standard symplectic form, a Lagrangian subspace is a 2-dimensional subspace on which the symplectic form vanishes. So each face is a flat Lagrangian disk (or polygon) lying in a Lagrangian plane.\n\nThe condition \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\" is a combinatorial condition: at every vertex, exactly four faces meet. This is like a condition on the polyhedral complex.\n\nThe question: does K admit a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K? This likely means: can we deform K through a family of Lagrangian submanifolds (via a Hamiltonian flow) to a smooth Lagrangian submanifold? Or more precisely, is there a Hamiltonian isotopy that smoothes out the polyhedral Lagrangian surface into a smooth Lagrangian surface? The notation K_t -> K might indicate that as t goes to 0, K_t converges to K, and for t>0, K_t is smooth.\n\nWe need to formalize these concepts.\n\nCore definitions:\n\n1. Polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4.\n   - Term: \"Polyhedral Lagrangian surface\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A polyhedral 2-dimensional surface in R^4 (possibly with boundary) such that each face (polygon) is contained in a Lagrangian affine subspace (i.e., the affine subspace is Lagrangian with respect to the standard symplectic form on R^4). Alternatively, each face is a Lagrangian submanifold (flat and Lagrangian).\n   - Confidence: Medium, because \"polyhedral\" might be interpreted in different ways (e.g., piecewise linear, simplicial, etc.). Also, \"Lagrangian\" for a face might mean that the face is a subset of a Lagrangian subspace.\n   - Source candidates: Standard references on symplectic geometry and Lagrangian submanifolds, e.g., McDuff and Salamon's \"Introduction to Symplectic Topology\", Arnold's \"Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics\". But for polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces, it might be more specialized, perhaps in papers on Lagrangian skeleta or singular Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n2. Lagrangian face.\n   - Term: \"Lagrangian face\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A face (polygon) of a polyhedral surface that lies in an affine Lagrangian subspace of R^4.\n   - Confidence: Medium.\n   - Source candidates: Same as above.\n\n3. Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing.\n   - Term: \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A family of Lagrangian submanifolds {K_t} for t in (0,1] such that K_t is smooth for t>0, K_0 = K (the polyhedral surface), and the family is generated by a Hamiltonian flow. More precisely, there exists a smooth family of Hamiltonian functions H_t such that the time-t flow of the Hamiltonian vector field X_{H_t} takes K to K_t (or deforms K into K_t). Alternatively, K_t = \u03c6_t(K) where \u03c6_t is a Hamiltonian isotopy.\n   - Confidence: Medium, because smoothing might mean that K_t becomes a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, and the deformation is through Hamiltonian isotopy.\n   - Source candidates: McDuff and Salamon on Hamiltonian isotopies and Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n4. 4 faces meeting at each vertex.\n   - Term: \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: At every vertex of the polyhedral surface, exactly four faces (2-dimensional cells) are incident.\n   - Confidence: High.\n   - Source candidates: Basic polyhedral geometry.\n\nWe might also need to define Lagrangian submanifold, Hamiltonian isotopy, etc.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.\" So we should list the core definitions that are specific to the problem. Also, we need to provide source candidates (likely references).\n\nWe should also include definitions for standard terms if they are critical, but perhaps we can assume some background. However, the minimal_dependency_set should list items that are critical.\n\nLet's think about what is needed to understand the problem:\n\n- Symplectic manifold (R^4 with standard symplectic form).\n- Lagrangian submanifold (or subspace).\n- Polyhedral surface (piecewise linear).\n- Hamiltonian diffeomorphism/isotopy.\n- Smoothing of a polyhedral surface.\n\nWe need to provide these as core_definitions or in minimal_dependency_set.\n\nBut note: core_definitions is for terms that appear in the problem statement and need formal definition. The problem statement uses \"polyhedral Lagrangian surface\", \"faces Lagrangian\", \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\", \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\". So these are the terms to define.\n\nWe might also need to define \"Lagrangian smoothing\" without Hamiltonian? But the problem says \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\".\n\nWe should also consider ambiguity: What exactly is meant by \"polyhedral\"? Is it a simplicial complex? A CW complex? Are the faces polygons? Are they necessarily flat? Is the surface closed or with boundary? The problem says \"surface\", so likely a 2-dimensional polyhedral complex. Also, \"Lagrangian\" for a face: does it mean that the face is a Lagrangian submanifold with boundary? Since faces are polygons, they are flat, so they are Lagrangian if they lie in a Lagrangian plane.\n\nAnother ambiguity: The smoothing: is it required that K_t is Lagrangian for all t? And smooth for t>0? And the convergence is as what? As sets? In some topology?\n\nWe should flag these ambiguities.\n\nNow, statement_targets: We need to identify"
