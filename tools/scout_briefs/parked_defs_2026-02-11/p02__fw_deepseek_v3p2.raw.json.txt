We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or strategies.\n\nWe need to output JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, identify the problem_id. It is given as \"P02\", so we use that.\n\nNow, we need to provide core definitions. These are terms that are essential to understand the problem. We need to provide for each term: term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates.\n\nList of terms that likely need definition:\n\n1. Non-archimedean local field F.\n2. Generic irreducible admissible representation Pi of GL_{n+1}(F) and pi of GL_n(F).\n3. Whittaker models W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and W(pi, psi).\n4. Additive character psi with conductor o.\n5. Conductor ideal q of pi.\n6. Q generates q^{-1}.\n7. u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}.\n8. The integral: int_{N_n\\GL_n(F)} W(diag(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg.\n\nWe need to provide formal definitions for these terms. Also, we need to provide source candidates (likely references). Since this is about representations of GL_n over non-archimedean local fields, typical sources are:\n\n- Jacquet, H., Piatetski-Shapiro, I., and Shalika, J.

We are not to provide proofs, only definitions and citation targets.\n\nWe also need statement_targets: these are statements that we need to look up, likely theorems or propositions that are needed to proceed. For example, the definition of the conductor ideal, the properties of Whittaker models, etc.\n\nMinimal_dependency_set: items that are critical to define the integral properly, such as measures, normalization, etc.\n\nAmbiguity_flags: things that are ambiguous in the problem statement.\n\nDo_not_assume: things we should not assume.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nCore definitions:\n\n1. Non-archimedean local field F: A non-archimedean local field is a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Q_p or of the field of formal Laurent series F_q((t)) over a finite field. Formal definition: A field F equipped with a discrete valuation v: F* -> Z such that the residue field is finite and F is complete with respect to the metric induced by the valuation.\n\n2. Generic irreducible admissible representation: For a reductive group G over F, an admissible representation is a representation (\u03c0, V) such that for every open compact subgroup K, the space of K-fixed vectors is finite-dimensional. Irreducible means no nontrivial invariant subspaces. Generic means that there exists a nonzero Whittaker functional. More formally, a representation \u03c0 of GL_n(F) is generic if there exists a nonzero linear functional L on the space of \u03c0 such that L(\u03c0(n)v) = \u03c8(n)L(v) for all v and n in the maximal unipotent subgroup N, where \u03c8 is a nondegenerate character of N.\n\n3. Whittaker models: Given a generic representation \u03c0 of GL_n(F) and a nondegenerate additive character \u03c8 of F, the Whittaker model W(\u03c0, \u03c8) is the image of \u03c0 under an intertwining map into the space of functions on GL_n(F) satisfying W(ng) = \u03c8(n)W(g) for n in N, and W is smooth and right K-finite. Alternatively, it is the unique subspace of functions on GL_n(F) isomorphic to \u03c0 and transforming on the left by \u03c8 under N.\n\n4. Additive character \u03c8 with conductor o: An additive character \u03c8: F -> C* such that \u03c8 is trivial on the ring of integers o but not on any larger fractional ideal. Usually, conductor o means that \u03c8 is unramified, i.e., trivial on o but nontrivial on p^{-1}? Actually, conductor o typically means that the conductor is the ring of integers, so \u03c8 is trivial on o and nontrivial on p^{-1}. But we need to be careful: sometimes conductor o means that the conductor is o, so the largest ideal on which \u03c8 is trivial is o. So \u03c8 is trivial on o, but not on any larger ideal? Actually, if \u03c8 is trivial on o, then it is trivial on any subset of o. The conductor is the largest ideal on which \u03c8 is trivial. So if conductor is o, then \u03c8 is trivial on o, and for any x not in o, \u03c8(x) might not be 1. But typically, additive characters are normalized so that conductor is the ring of integers for the trivial character? Actually, we need a precise definition.\n\n5. Conductor ideal q of \u03c0: This is likely the conductor ideal of the representation \u03c0, which is an ideal in o associated to \u03c0. For GL_n, the conductor is often defined via the epsilon factor or the Godement-Jacquet zeta integral. Alternatively, it might be the ideal such that the new vector is invariant under a certain congruence subgroup. Typically, for an irreducible admissible representation \u03c0 of GL_n(F), there is an ideal c(\u03c0) called the conductor, which is a non-negative integer exponent such that the conductor ideal is p^{c(\u03c0)}. But here it is denoted q, so q is an ideal. Possibly q = p^{c(\u03c0)}.\n\n6. Q generates q^{-1}: q is an ideal in o, so q^{-1} is the inverse ideal in the sense of fractional ideals. Q is an element that generates q^{-1} as an o-module. Since q^{-1} is a fractional ideal, Q is an element of F such that q^{-1} = Q o. But careful: q^{-1} might be interpreted as the ideal inverse to q in the ideal group, so if q is a prime power, then q^{-1} is p^{-v(q)}. So Q is a uniformizer raised to the negative of the valuation of q? Possibly Q is an element of F with valuation equal to -v(q).\n\n7. u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}: This is a matrix in GL_{n+1}(F). I_{n+1} is the identity matrix, and E_{n,n+1} is the matrix unit with 1 at position (n, n+1). So u_Q is an upper triangular unipotent matrix with Q at the (n, n+1) entry.\n\n8. The integral"
