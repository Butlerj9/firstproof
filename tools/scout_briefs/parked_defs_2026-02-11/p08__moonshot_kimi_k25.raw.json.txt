I need to output strict JSON with specific keys.\n\n Let me analyze the problem:\n 1. Polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$\n 2. All faces are Lagrangian\n 3. 4 faces meeting at each vertex\n 4. Question: whether $K$ admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing $K_t \\to K$\n\n I need to provide:\n - Core definitions: terms like \"polyhedral Lagrangian surface\", \"Lagrangian face\", \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\"\n - Statement targets: theorems or results that would be needed\n - Minimal dependency set: what mathematical tools/concepts are critical\n - Ambiguity flags: unclear aspects\n - do_not_assume: things I shouldn't take for granted\n\n Key concepts to define:\n 1. Lagrangian submanifold (standard symplectic geometry)\n 2. Polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^4$\n 3. Lagrangian condition for polyhedral surfaces\n 4. Hamiltonian isotopy/smoothing\n 5. Convergence $K_t \\to K$\n 6. Singular Lagrangian surfaces\n\n Important sources to consider:\n - Symplectic geometry texts (McDuff-Salamon, Cannas da Silva)\n - Papers on Lagrangian surfaces with singularities\n - Audin, Lalonde, Sikorav work on Lagrangian submanifolds\n - Gromov's work on Lagrangian intersection theory\n - Specific papers on polyhedral or piecewise linear Lagrangians\n - Joyce's work on special Lagrangians with singularities (might be too specialized)\n - Stefan Nemirovski's work on Lagrangian embeddings and complexity\n\n Let me think about the specific definitions:\n\n 1. **Lagrangian submanifold**: In $(\\mathbb{R}^4, \\omega_0)$ where $\\omega_0 = dx_1 \\wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \\wedge dy_2$, a submanifold $L$ is Lagrangian if $\\dim L = 2$ and $\\omega_0|_L = 0$.\n\n 2. **Polyhedral Lagrangian**: A piecewise linear (or piecewise smooth) surface where each face is Lagrangian. This means each face is a 2-dimensional polygon (or smooth disk) with the Lagrangian condition holding on the interior.\n\n 3. **Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing**: A 1-parameter family $K_t$ of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds converging to $K$ as $t \\to 0$, where the convergence is in some appropriate topology (Hausdorff? Currents?), and each $K_t$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a standard form, or the smoothing is realized via Hamiltonian isotopy.\n\n Wait, the phrase \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" is ambiguous. It could mean:\n - A smoothing $K_t$ where each $K_t$ is Lagrangian and the family is generated by a Hamiltonian function\n - Or a smoothing that is \"Hamiltonian\" in the sense of being isotopic through Hamiltonian deformations\n\n Actually, looking at the notation $K_t \\to K$, this suggests a convergence of submanifolds. The term \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" likely refers to a smooth family of Lagrangian submanifolds $K_t$ converging to the singular object $K$, where the convergence is regular enough.\n\n 4. **Vertex condition**: 4 faces meeting at each vertex. This suggests a combinatorial condition. In a polyhedral surface, normally edges meet at vertices. If 4 faces meet at a vertex, this is a specific local combinatorial structure.\n\n Actually, for a surface, faces meet along edges. At a vertex, multiple faces meet. If 4 faces meet at each vertex, this means the link of the vertex consists of 4 points (so the vertex is a \"flat\" point combinatorially?).\n\n Wait, let me reconsider: A polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ has:\n - 2-dimensional faces\n - 1-dimensional edges (intersection of two faces)\n - 0-dimensional vertices\n\n At a vertex $v$, several faces meet. The condition \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\" means exactly 4 faces have $v$ as a boundary point.\n\n This is a very specific condition. In a generic polyhedral surface in 4-space, the number of faces meeting at a vertex could vary.\n\n Potential sources:\n - \"Lagrangian submanifolds of $\\mathbb{C}^n$\" by Audin\n - \"Symplectic geometry\" by McDuff and Salamon\n - \"Introduction to symplectic and Hamiltonian geometry\" by Cannas da Silva\n - Papers by Eliashberg, Gromov on Lagrangian intersection theory\n - \"The topology of Lagrangian submanifolds\" - various authors\n - Recent work on \"flexible\" vs \"rigid\" Lagrangians\n\n Specific to polyhedral Lagrangians:\n - There might be work by Sauvaget, or by Dimitroglou Rizell\n - \"Piecewise linear Lagrangian submanifolds\" might be a specific topic\n\n Let me think about the technical definitions needed:\n\n **Symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^4$**: $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^2 dx_i \\wedge dy_i$.\n\n **Lagrangian condition**: For a smooth submanifold $L^2 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4$, $\\omega|_L = 0$ and $\\dim L = 2$.\n\n **Polyhedral surface**: A topological surface $K$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ (or immersed) with a cell decomposition such that each 2-cell (face) is mapped as a polygon (linear or smooth) in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\n **Lagrangian faces**: Each face $F$ satisfies $\\omega|_F = 0$. Since $F$ is 2-dimensional and linear (or contained in an affine 2-plane), this means the affine 2-plane containing $F$ must be Lagrangian.\n\n **Hamiltonian smoothing**: This is the delicate part. One needs:\n 1. Definition of smoothing of singular Lagrangians\n 2. Hamiltonian isotopy classes\n 3. Lagrangian neighborhood theorems (Weinstein)\n\n The question seems to be asking whether a polyhedral Lagrangian can be approximated by smooth Lagrangians via Hamiltonian isotopies or whether there exists a smooth family $K_t$ of Lagrangian submanifolds converging to $K$.\n\n Actually, \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" might refer to:\n - A smooth family $\\{K_t\\}_{t>0}$ of Lagrangian submanifolds\n - Such that $K_t \\to K$ as $t \\to 0$ (in Hausdorff topology, or as currents)\n - And the family is Hamiltonian in the sense that $K_t = \\phi_t(K_1)$ for a Hamiltonian isotopy $\\phi_t$ (but this doesn't make sense as $t \\to 0$)\n - OR: The smoothing is achieved by a Hamiltonian vector field flow\n\n Actually, looking at standard terminology: A \"Hamiltonian smoothing\" usually means smoothing via Hamiltonian isotopy. But since $K$ is singular and $K_t"
