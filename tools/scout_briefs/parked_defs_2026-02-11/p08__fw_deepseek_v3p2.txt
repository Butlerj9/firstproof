Response:
We are given a problem about a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4 with all faces Lagrangian and 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The question is whether K admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or strategies. We must output in strict JSON format with keys: problem_id, core_definitions, statement_targets, minimal_dependency_set, ambiguity_flags, do_not_assume. First, identify the problem_id. It is given as "P08" in the context. Now, we need to extract core definitions. The problem involves: - Polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4. - "All faces Lagrangian": each face (presumably each 2-dimensional face) is a Lagrangian submanifold of R^4. - "4 faces meeting at each vertex": the combinatorial condition that at each vertex, exactly four faces meet. - "Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing": a smooth family of Lagrangian submanifolds K_t that converge to K as t -> 0, and the deformation is Hamiltonian. We need formal definitions for: 1. Polyhedral surface in R^4. Possibly a piecewise-linear surface made of polygons (faces) that are flat? ...
