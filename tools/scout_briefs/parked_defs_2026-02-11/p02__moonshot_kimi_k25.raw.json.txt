The context involves:\n \n 1. Non-archimedean local field $F$\n 2. Generic irreducible admissible representations $\\Pi$ of $GL_{n+1}(F)$ and $\\pi$ of $GL_n(F)$\n 3. Whittaker models $\\mathcal{W}(\\Pi, \\psi^{-1})$ and $\\mathcal{W}(\\pi, \\psi)$\n 4. Additive character $\\psi$ with conductor $\\mathfrak{o}$\n 5. Conductor ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ of $\\pi$, $Q$ generates $\\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$\n 6. Matrix $u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}$\n 7. Integral: $\\int_{N_n\\backslash GL_n(F)} W(\\text{diag}(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |\\det g|^{s-1/2} dg$\n \n This appears to be related to Rankin-Selberg integrals for $GL_{n+1} \\times GL_n$, specifically the Jacquet-Piatetski-Shapiro-Shalika (JPSS) zeta integral or local integrals in the context of $L$-functions.\n \n I need to provide:\n 1. Core definitions with formal candidates and sources\n 2. Statement targets (theorems/lemmas needed)\n 3. Minimal dependency set\n 4. Ambiguity flags\n 5. Do not assume list\n \n STRICT JSON output only.\n \n Let me identify the key concepts:\n \n 1. **Non-archimedean local field**: Standard definition, but need formal reference.\n 2. **Generic representation**: Representation with a Whittaker model.\n 3. **Admissible representation**: Smooth representation where fixed vectors under open compact subgroups are finite-dimensional.\n 4. **Whittaker model**: Space of functions satisfying certain transformation properties under the unipotent radical.\n 5. **Conductor ideal**: The conductor of a representation.\n 6. **The specific integral**: This looks like a local Rankin-Selberg integral.\n \n The integral resembles the one in Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika (JPSS) or perhaps in Cogdell's work on $L$-functions for $GL(n)$.\n \n Let me think about the specific form:\n $\\int_{N_n\\backslash GL_n(F)} W(\\text{diag}(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |\\det g|^{s-1/2} dg$\n \n This is almost certainly the local integral appearing in the functional equation or the local zeta integral for $GL(n+1) \\times GL(n)$ with a \"twist\" by $u_Q$ to handle the conductor.\n \n Key references:\n 1. Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika - \"Rankin-Selberg convolutions\" (1983)\n 2. Jacquet - \"Principal $L$-functions of the linear group\" (1979)\n 3. Cogdell - \"$L$-functions and converse theorems for $GL_n$\" (2004)\n 4. Jacquet-Langlands for $n=1$ case.\n \n For the conductor and the specific matrix $u_Q$: The element $Q$ generates $\\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, and $u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}$ is a specific unipotent element. This suggests we are looking at the \"new vector\" or \"essential vector\" theory.\n \n Wait, the presence of $u_Q$ suggests this is related to the functional equation or the local integral at the \"bad\" places. The matrix $u_Q$ is used to \"balance\" the conductor.\n \n Actually, looking at the integral form, this appears to be the local zeta integral for the Rankin-Selberg convolution $L(s, \\Pi \\times \\pi)$, but with a twist. The standard zeta integral is:\n $\\Psi(s, W, W') = \\int_{N_n\\backslash GL_n(F)} W(\\begin{pmatrix} g & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}) W'(g) |\\det g|^{s-1/2} dg$\n \n Here we have $u_Q$ inserted: $W(\\text{diag}(g,1) u_Q)$. \n \n This modification by $u_Q$ is characteristic of the \"approximate functional equation\" or the handling of the conductor in the local theory. The matrix $u_Q$ is sometimes called a \"translator\" or used in the theory of new vectors.\n \n Let me check: For $\\pi$ with conductor $\\mathfrak{q}$, and $Q$ a generator of $\\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, the element $u_Q$ is used in the functional equation or in the definition of the gamma factor.\n \n Actually, this integral looks like it appears in the context of the local functional equation or in the computation of the $L$-factor. The presence of $Q$ generating the inverse of the conductor suggests this is related to the \"twisted\" integral that appears in the theory of $L$-functions and $\\varepsilon$-factors.\n \n Key sources to cite:\n 1. JPSS - \"Rankin-Selberg Convolutions\" (1983) in Amer. J. Math.\n 2. Jacquet - \"Automorphic forms on GL(2)\" part II (for the classical theory)\n 3. Cogdell's notes or survey articles.\n 4. For conductors: Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika or Bushnell-Henniart for local fields.\n \n Let me be more precise about the definitions:\n \n 1. **Non-archimedean local field**: A locally compact topological field with non-trivial absolute value, not equal to $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, or equivalently, a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ or $\\mathbb{F}_q((t))$.\n \n 2. **Additive character $\\psi$ with conductor $\\mathfrak{o}$**: $\\psi: F \\to \\mathbb{C}^*$ is a continuous homomorphism, and the conductor is the largest fractional ideal on which $\\psi$ is trivial. If conductor is $\\mathfrak{o}$ (the ring of integers), then $\\psi$ is unramified or \"normalized\".\n \n 3. **Generic representation**: An irreducible admissible representation $(\\pi, V)$ of $G$ is generic if there exists a non-zero Whittaker functional, equivalently if it embeds in the space of Whittaker functions.\n \n 4. **Whittaker model**: For a standard non-degenerate character $\\psi$ of the maximal unipotent subgroup $N$, the Whittaker model $\\mathcal{W}(\\pi, \\psi)$ is the image of $V$ under the intertwining map $v \\mapsto W_v(g) = \\lambda(\\pi(g)v)$ where $\\lambda$ is a Whittaker functional.\n \n 5. **Conductor ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ of $\\pi$**: For $GL_n$, the conductor is an ideal $\\mathfrak{q} = \\mathfrak{p}^{f(\\pi)}$ where $f(\\pi)$ is the conductor exponent. It can be defined via the $L$- and $\\varepsilon$-factors, or"
