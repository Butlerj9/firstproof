We are given a problem context involving non-archimedean local fields, representations of GL_n, Whittaker models, and an integral. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or strategies.  We need to output JSON with specific keys.  First, identify the problem_id. It is given as "P02", so we use that.  Now, we need to provide core definitions. These are terms that are essential to understand the problem. We need to provide for each term: term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates.  List of terms that likely need definition:  1. Non-archimedean local field F. 2. Generic irreducible admissible representation Pi of GL_{n+1}(F) and pi of GL_n(F). 3. Whittaker models W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and W(pi, psi). 4. Additive character psi with conductor o. 5. Conductor ideal q of pi. 6. Q generates q^{-1}. 7. u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}. 8. The integral: int_{N_n\GL_n(F)} W(diag(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg.  We need to provide formal definitions for these terms. Also, we need to provide source candidates (likely references). Since this is about representations of GL_n over non-archimedean local fields, typical sources are:  - Jacquet, H., Piatetski-Shapiro, I., and Shalika, J. (1981). "Conducteur des représentations du groupe linéaire." Math. Ann. 256, 199–214. - Bushnell, C. J., and Henniart, G. (2006). "The local Langlands conjecture for GL(2)." Springer. - Godement, R., and Jacquet, H. (1972). "Zeta functions of simple algebras." Lecture Notes in Mathematics, Vol. 260, Springer. - Cogdell, J. W., and Piatetski-Shapiro, I. I. (1994).

The user wants me to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets for a specific problem in mathematics (Problem P02). The context involves:    1. Non-archimedean local field $F$  2. Generic irreducible admissible representations $\Pi$ of $GL_{n+1}(F)$ and $\pi$ of $GL_n(F)$  3. Whittaker models $\mathcal{W}(\Pi, \psi^{-1})$ and $\mathcal{W}(\pi, \psi)$  4. Additive character $\psi$ with conductor $\mathfrak{o}$  5. Conductor ideal $\mathfrak{q}$ of $\pi$, $Q$ generates $\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$  6. Matrix $u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}$  7. Integral: $\int_{N_n\backslash GL_n(F)} W(\text{diag}(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |\det g|^{s-1/2} dg$    This appears to be related to Rankin-Selberg integrals for $GL_{n+1} \times GL_n$, specifically the Jacquet-Piatetski-Shapiro-Shalika (JPSS) zeta integral or local integrals in the context of $L$-functions.    I need to provide:  1. Core definitions with formal candidates and sources  2. Statement targets (theorems/lemmas needed)  3. Minimal dependency set  4. Ambiguity flags  5. Do not assume list    STRICT JSON output only.    Let me identify the key concepts:    1. **Non-archimedean local field**: Standard definition, but need formal reference.  2. **Generic representation**: Representation with a Whittaker model.  3. **Admissible representation**: Smooth representation where fixed vectors under open compact subgroups are finite-dimensional.  4. **Whittaker model**: Space of functions satisfying certain transformation properties under the unipotent radical.  5. **Conductor ideal**: The conductor of a representation.  6. **The specific integral**: This looks like a local Rankin-Selberg integral.    The integral resembles the one in Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika (JPSS) or perhaps in Cogdell's work o ...

We are given a problem context about a finite group G, an incomplete transfer system O associated to an N∞ operad, and two needs:   1. Define O-adapted slice filtration on G-equivariant stable category.  2. Characterize O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum via geometric fixed points.   We are to provide only candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets.   We are not to provide proof ideas, strategies, etc.   We are to output in strict JSON format with specified keys.   Steps:  1. Identify the problem_id: We are given "Problem P05 context", so problem_id is "P05".  2. core_definitions: We need to define terms that are central to the problem.      Terms might include:        - Finite group G (assumed known, but we can note it)       - Incomplete transfer system O associated to an N∞ operad.       - O-adapted slice filtration.       - G-equivariant stable category.       - O-slice connectivity.       - Connective G-spectrum.       - Geometric fixed points.      For each term, we provide a formal definition candidate, confidence, and source candidates (likely references).   3. statement_targets: We need to identify statements (theorems, definitions) that are needed to proceed.      For example, the definition of O-adapted slice filtration and the characterization of O-slice connectivity via geometric fixed points.   4. minimal_dependency_set: What are the minimal dependencies (e.g., definitions, theorems) that are critical to the problem?   5. ambiguity_flags: Any ambiguities in the problem statement or context.   6. do_not_assume: Things we should not assume.   Since the problem is about equivariant homotopy theory and uses concepts from recent work on N∞ operads and slice filtrations, we should look for sources like ...

We are given a problem about a uniform lattice Gamma in a real semisimple Lie group, with 2-torsion. We are asked whether there exists a compact manifold M with fundamental group pi_1(M)=Gamma and universal cover M~ rationally acyclic.  We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or answer the problem.  We need to output JSON with specific keys.  Let's break down the problem:  1. Gamma is a uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group. 2. Gamma has 2-torsion. 3. We are to consider the existence of a compact manifold M such that pi_1(M) = Gamma and the universal cover M~ is rationally acyclic.  We need to define: - Uniform lattice - Real semisimple Lie group - 2-torsion (in the context of a group) - Rationally acyclic (for a space)  Also, we might need to clarify what is meant by "universal cover M~ rationally acyclic".  We need to provide candidate formal definitions and source candidates (likely from standard references in Lie groups, geometric group theory, and algebraic topology).  We also need to identify statement targets: what statements from the literature might be relevant? For example, there might be known results about the existence of such manifolds for certain groups, or obstructions.  But note: we are only to provide citation targets, not proof strategies.  We also need to list minimal dependency set: what are the critical concepts or theorems that are necessary to even state the problem precisely?  Ambiguity flags: any ambiguities in the problem statement.  Do not assume: things we should not assume.  Let's proceed step by step.  First, problem_id: given as P07.  Core definitions:  We need to define: - Uniform lattice - Real semisimple Lie group - 2-torsion - Ratio ...

We are given a problem about a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4 with all faces Lagrangian and 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The question is whether K admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets only. We are not to provide proof ideas or attempt to answer the problem.  We need to output strict JSON with keys: problem_id, core_definitions, statement_targets, minimal_dependency_set, ambiguity_flags, do_not_assume.  First, identify the problem_id. It is given as "Problem P08 context", so we can set problem_id: "P08".  Now, we need to provide core_definitions. We need to define terms that are central to the problem. The terms include: - Polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4. - Lagrangian faces. - 4 faces meeting at each vertex. - Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing. - K_t -> K (smoothing).  We need to provide formal definition candidates, confidence, and source candidates (likely references).  We also need statement_targets: likely statements from literature that are needed, e.g., definitions, theorems about Lagrangian smoothing, Hamiltonian isotopy, etc.  Minimal_dependency_set: items that are critical to understand the problem, e.g., definitions of Lagrangian submanifolds, Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, etc.  Ambiguity_flags: any ambiguities in the problem statement.  Do_not_assume: things we should not assume.  Let's break down the problem:  We have a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4. "Polyhedral" likely means it is a piecewise linear surface made of polygons (faces). "Lagrangian" means each face is a Lagrangian subspace or a Lagrangian submanifold? Actually, it says "all faces Lagrangian", so each face is a Lagrangian submanifold (or perhaps a linear Lagran ...

I need to output strict JSON with specific keys.   Let me analyze the problem:  1. Polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^4$  2. All faces are Lagrangian  3. 4 faces meeting at each vertex  4. Question: whether $K$ admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing $K_t \to K$   I need to provide:  - Core definitions: terms like "polyhedral Lagrangian surface", "Lagrangian face", "Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing"  - Statement targets: theorems or results that would be needed  - Minimal dependency set: what mathematical tools/concepts are critical  - Ambiguity flags: unclear aspects  - do_not_assume: things I shouldn't take for granted   Key concepts to define:  1. Lagrangian submanifold (standard symplectic geometry)  2. Polyhedral surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$  3. Lagrangian condition for polyhedral surfaces  4. Hamiltonian isotopy/smoothing  5. Convergence $K_t \to K$  6. Singular Lagrangian surfaces   Important sources to consider:  - Symplectic geometry texts (McDuff-Salamon, Cannas da Silva)  - Papers on Lagrangian surfaces with singularities  - Audin, Lalonde, Sikorav work on Lagrangian submanifolds  - Gromov's work on Lagrangian intersection theory  - Specific papers on polyhedral or piecewise linear Lagrangians  - Joyce's work on special Lagrangians with singularities (might be too specialized)  - Stefan Nemirovski's work on Lagrangian embeddings and complexity   Let me think about the specific definitions:   1. **Lagrangian submanifold**: In $(\mathbb{R}^4, \omega_0)$ where $\omega_0 = dx_1 \wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \wedge dy_2$, a submanifold $L$ is Lagrangian if $\dim L ...
