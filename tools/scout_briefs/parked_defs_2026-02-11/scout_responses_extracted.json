We are not to provide proof ideas or strategies.\n\nWe need to output JSON with specific keys.\n\nFirst, identify the problem_id. It is given as \"P02\", so we use that.\n\nNow, we need to provide core definitions. These are terms that are essential to understand the problem. We need to provide for each term: term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates.\n\nList of terms that likely need definition:\n\n1. Non-archimedean local field F.\n2. Generic irreducible admissible representation Pi of GL_{n+1}(F) and pi of GL_n(F).\n3. Whittaker models W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and W(pi, psi).\n4. Additive character psi with conductor o.\n5.

The integral: int_{N_n\\GL_n(F)} W(diag(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg.\n\nWe need to provide formal definitions for these terms. Also, we need to provide source candidates (likely references). Since this is about representations of GL_n over non-archimedean local fields, typical sources are:\n\n- Jacquet, H., Piatetski-Shapiro, I., and Shalika, J.

We are not to provide proofs, only definitions and citation targets.\n\nWe also need statement_targets: these are statements that we need to look up, likely theorems or propositions that are needed to proceed. For example, the definition of the conductor ideal, the properties of Whittaker models, etc.\n\nMinimal_dependency_set: items that are critical to define the integral properly, such as measures, normalization, etc.\n\nAmbiguity_flags: things that are ambiguous in the problem statement.\n\nDo_not_assume: things we should not assume.\n\nLet's break down:\n\nCore definitions:\n\n1. Non-archimedean local field F: A non-archimedean local field is a finite extension of the p-adic numbers Q_p or of the field of formal Laurent series F_q((t)) over a finite field. Formal definition: A field F equipped with a discrete valuation v: F* -> Z such that the residue field is finite and F is complete with respect to the metric induced by the valuation.\n\n2. Generic irreducible admissible representation: For a reductive group G over F, an admissible representation is a representation (π, V) such that for every open compact subgroup K, the space of K-fixed vectors is finite-dimensional. Irreducible means no nontrivial invariant subspaces. Generic means that there exists a nonzero Whittaker functional. More formally, a representation π of GL_n(F) is generic if there exists a nonzero linear functional L on the space of π such that L(π(n)v) = ψ(n)L(v) for all v and n in the maximal unipotent subgroup N, where ψ is a nondegenerate character of N.\n\n3. Whittaker models: Given a generic representation π of GL_n(F) and a nondegenerate additive character ψ of F, the Whittaker model W(π, ψ) is the image of π under an intertwining map into the space of functions on GL_n(F) satisfying W(ng) = ψ(n)W(g) for n in N, and W is smooth and right K-finite. Alternatively, it is the unique subspace of functions on GL_n(F) isomorphic to π and transforming on the left by ψ under N.\n\n4. Additive character ψ with conductor o: An additive character ψ: F -> C* such that ψ is trivial on the ring of integers o but not on any larger fractional ideal. Usually, conductor o means that ψ is unramified, i.e., trivial on o but nontrivial on p^{-1}? Actually, conductor o typically means that the conductor is the ring of integers, so ψ is trivial on o and nontrivial on p^{-1}. But we need to be careful: sometimes conductor o means that the conductor is o, so the largest ideal on which ψ is trivial is o. So ψ is trivial on o, but not on any larger ideal? Actually, if ψ is trivial on o, then it is trivial on any subset of o. The conductor is the largest ideal on which ψ is trivial. So if conductor is o, then ψ is trivial on o, and for any x not in o, ψ(x) might not be 1. But typically, additive characters are normalized so that conductor is the ring of integers for the trivial character? Actually, we need a precise definition.\n\n5. Conductor ideal q of π: This is likely the conductor ideal of the representation π, which is an ideal in o associated to π. For GL_n, the conductor is often defined via the epsilon factor or the Godement-Jacquet zeta integral. Alternatively, it might be the ideal such that the new vector is invariant under a certain congruence subgroup. Typically, for an irreducible admissible representation π of GL_n(F), there is an ideal c(π) called the conductor, which is a non-negative integer exponent such that the conductor ideal is p^{c(π)}. But here it is denoted q, so q is an ideal. Possibly q = p^{c(π)}.\n\n6. Q generates q^{-1}: q is an ideal in o, so q^{-1} is the inverse ideal in the sense of fractional ideals. Q is an element that generates q^{-1} as an o-module. Since q^{-1} is a fractional ideal, Q is an element of F such that q^{-1} = Q o. But careful: q^{-1} might be interpreted as the ideal inverse to q in the ideal group, so if q is a prime power, then q^{-1} is p^{-v(q)}. So Q is a uniformizer raised to the negative of the valuation of q? Possibly Q is an element of F with valuation equal to -v(q).\n\n7. u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}: This is a matrix in GL_{n+1}(F). I_{n+1} is the identity matrix, and E_{n,n+1} is the matrix unit with 1 at position (n, n+1). So u_Q is an upper triangular unipotent matrix with Q at the (n, n+1) entry.\n\n8. The integral",

Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika - \"Rankin-Selberg convolutions\" (1983)\n 2. Jacquet - \"Principal $L$-functions of the linear group\" (1979)\n 3. Cogdell - \"$L$-functions and converse theorems for $GL_n$\" (2004)\n 4. Jacquet-Langlands for $n=1$ case.\n \n For the conductor and the specific matrix $u_Q$: The element $Q$ generates $\\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, and $u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}$ is a specific unipotent element. This suggests we are looking at the \"new vector\" or \"essential vector\" theory.\n \n Wait, the presence of $u_Q$ suggests this is related to the functional equation or the local integral at the \"bad\" places. The matrix $u_Q$ is used to \"balance\" the conductor.\n \n Actually, looking at the integral form, this appears to be the local zeta integral for the Rankin-Selberg convolution $L(s, \\Pi \\times \\pi)$, but with a twist. The standard zeta integral is:\n $\\Psi(s, W, W') = \\int_{N_n\\backslash GL_n(F)} W(\\begin{pmatrix} g & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}) W'(g) |\\det g|^{s-1/2} dg$\n \n Here we have $u_Q$ inserted: $W(\\text{diag}(g,1) u_Q)$. \n \n This modification by $u_Q$ is characteristic of the \"approximate functional equation\" or the handling of the conductor in the local theory. The matrix $u_Q$ is sometimes called a \"translator\" or used in the theory of new vectors.\n \n Let me check: For $\\pi$ with conductor $\\mathfrak{q}$, and $Q$ a generator of $\\mathfrak{q}^{-1}$, the element $u_Q$ is used in the functional equation or in the definition of the gamma factor.\n \n Actually, this integral looks like it appears in the context of the local functional equation or in the computation of the $L$-factor. The presence of $Q$ generating the inverse of the conductor suggests this is related to the \"twisted\" integral that appears in the theory of $L$-functions and $\\varepsilon$-factors.\n \n Key sources to cite:\n 1. JPSS - \"Rankin-Selberg Convolutions\" (1983) in Amer. J. Math.\n 2. Jacquet - \"Automorphic forms on GL(2)\" part II (for the classical theory)\n 3. Cogdell's notes or survey articles.\n 4. For conductors: Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, Shalika or Bushnell-Henniart for local fields.\n \n Let me be more precise about the definitions:\n \n 1. **Non-archimedean local field**: A locally compact topological field with non-trivial absolute value, not equal to $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, or equivalently, a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ or $\\mathbb{F}_q((t))$.\n \n 2. **Additive character $\\psi$ with conductor $\\mathfrak{o}$**: $\\psi: F \\to \\mathbb{C}^*$ is a continuous homomorphism, and the conductor is the largest fractional ideal on which $\\psi$ is trivial. If conductor is $\\mathfrak{o}$ (the ring of integers), then $\\psi$ is unramified or \"normalized\".\n \n 3. **Generic representation**: An irreducible admissible representation $(\\pi, V)$ of $G$ is generic if there exists a non-zero Whittaker functional, equivalently if it embeds in the space of Whittaker functions.\n \n 4. **Whittaker model**: For a standard non-degenerate character $\\psi$ of the maximal unipotent subgroup $N$, the Whittaker model $\\mathcal{W}(\\pi, \\psi)$ is the image of $V$ under the intertwining map $v \\mapsto W_v(g) = \\lambda(\\pi(g)v)$ where $\\lambda$ is a Whittaker functional.\n \n 5. **Conductor ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ of $\\pi$**: For $GL_n$, the conductor is an ideal $\\mathfrak{q} = \\mathfrak{p}^{f(\\pi)}$ where $f(\\pi)$ is the conductor exponent.

This might be from recent work on generalized slice filtrations.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Core definitions:\n\n Term: \"Incomplete transfer system O\"\n   Formal definition candidate: An incomplete transfer system on a finite group G is a collection of subgroups of G that is closed under conjugation and contains the trivial subgroup, but not necessarily all subgroups. It is associated to an N∞ operad, which encodes compatible multiplicative norm maps for the subgroups in the transfer system.\n   Confidence: medium, because the exact definition might vary. We are not given the group G, but it's finite.\n   Source candidates: [Blumberg-Hill, \"N∞ operads and parametrized spectra\", 2015; Blumberg-Hill, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 2017]\n\n Term: \"O-adapted slice filtration\"\n   Formal definition candidate: An O-adapted slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category is a filtration of G-spectra that is adapted to the transfer system O, meaning that the filtration respects the norm maps encoded by O. It is a generalization of the classical slice filtration (for complete transfer systems) to incomplete ones.\n   Confidence: low, because this is a specialized concept and we don't have a precise definition at hand.\n   Source candidates: [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, \"On the non-existence of elements of Kervaire invariant one\", 2016; recent work on generalized slice filtrations by Hill, Hopkins, and others]\n\n Term: \"G-equivariant stable category\"\n   Formal definition candidate: The category of G-spectra, which is the stable homotopy category of genuine G-equivariant spectra.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986; Mandell-May, \"Equivariant orthogonal spectra and S-modules\", 2002]\n\n Term: \"O-slice connectivity\"\n   Formal definition candidate: A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice n-connected if its n-th slice in the O-adapted slice filtration is contractible, or equivalently, if it lies in the non-negative part of the O-adapted slice filtration.\n   Confidence: low, because we are extrapolating from the classical slice connectivity.\n   Source candidates: [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, \"On the non-existence of elements of Kervaire invariant one\", 2016]\n\n Term: \"Connective G-spectrum\"\n   Formal definition candidate: A G-spectrum X is connective if its homotopy groups (or Mackey functor homotopy groups) are zero in negative degrees.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986]\n\n Term: \"Geometric fixed points\"\n   Formal definition candidate: For a G-spectrum X, the geometric fixed points Φ^H(X) for a subgroup H of G is the H-fixed points of the H-geometric fixed point spectrum of X, which is a non-equivariant spectrum.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986]\n\n However, note that the problem asks for a characterization via geometric fixed points.

The definition of the O-adapted slice filtration.\n   2. A theorem that characterizes O-slice connectivity in terms of geometric fixed points.\n\n For the first, we look for a source that defines the O-adapted slice filtration. Possibly in recent work by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel, or follow-ups.\n\n For the second, we look for a theorem that says something like: A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice n-connected if and only if for every subgroup H in the transfer system O (or perhaps every subgroup of G?), the geometric fixed points Φ^H(X) are n-connected.\n\n Minimal dependency set:\n\n We need:\n   - The definition of the G-equivariant stable category (to work in the right category).\n   - The definition of an incomplete transfer system O (to know which norms are available).\n   - The definition of the O-adapted slice filtration (the main object).\n   - The definition of geometric fixed points (for the characterization).\n\n Ambiguity flags:\n   - The problem does not specify the group G beyond being finite. The definitions might depend on the group.\n   - The transfer system O is incomplete, so we don't have norms for all subgroups. How exactly does the slice filtration adapt to O?\n   - The characterization via geometric fixed points: which subgroups do we take geometric fixed points for? All subgroups? Only those in O? Only certain ones?\n\n Do not assume:\n   - We should not assume that the transfer system O is complete (i.e., contains all subgroups).\n   - We should not assume that the O-adapted slice filtration is the same as the classical slice filtration.\n\n Let's structure the output accordingly.\n\n Note: We are to provide only candidate definitions and citation targets.

Term: Uniform lattice\n   Formal definition candidate: A discrete subgroup Gamma of a locally compact group G is a lattice if the quotient space G/Gamma has finite Haar measure. If in addition G/Gamma is compact, then Gamma is called a uniform lattice.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Margulis' book \"Discrete Subgroups of Semisimple Lie Groups\", Raghunathan's book \"Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups\", or Zimmer's book \"Ergodic Theory and Semisimple Groups\"]\n\n2. Term: Real semisimple Lie group\n   Formal definition candidate: A real Lie group is semisimple if its Lie algebra is semisimple, i.e., it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras (with no nonzero abelian ideal). Alternatively, a connected Lie group is semisimple if it has trivial radical (the largest connected solvable normal subgroup).\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Knapp's \"Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction\", Helgason's \"Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces\"]\n\n3. Term: 2-torsion\n   Formal definition candidate: A group Gamma has 2-torsion if there exists an element g in Gamma, g ≠ identity, such that g^2 = identity.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Standard group theory references, e.g., Rotman's \"An Introduction to the Theory of Groups\"]\n\n4. Term: Rationally acyclic\n   Formal definition candidate: A topological space X is rationally acyclic if its reduced rational homology groups are trivial, i.e., H_i(X; Q) = 0 for all i > 0. For the universal cover M~, we require that H_i(M~; Q) = 0 for all i > 0.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Hatcher's \"Algebraic Topology\", Spanier's \"Algebraic Topology\"]\n\nWe might also need to define \"compact manifold\" but that is standard.\n\nStatement targets: We need to identify statements from the literature that might be relevant. For example, there might be known results about when a group can be the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold, or about the existence of closed manifolds with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. Possibly related to the Singer conjecture or the Baum-Connes conjecture. But we are only to provide likely sources and labels.\n\nGiven the problem is about uniform lattices in semisimple Lie groups, one might look at results about cohomological dimension, duality properties, and the existence of classifying spaces. For example, if Gamma is a torsion-free lattice, then it is known that Gamma is the fundamental group of a closed locally symmetric space, and the universal cover is the symmetric space, which is contractible. But here Gamma has torsion, so it cannot act freely on a contractible manifold. However, the problem asks for a compact manifold M with pi_1(M)=Gamma, but the universal cover M~ is rationally acyclic, not necessarily contractible. So we are looking for a manifold M whose universal cover has trivial rational homology.\n\nThere might be known obstructions from group cohomology. For instance, if Gamma has torsion, then the cohomological dimension of Gamma might be infinite, but that doesn't necessarily preclude the existence of a finite-dimensional classifying space. However, if Gamma is a lattice with torsion, it might still have a finite classifying space? There are results about virtual cohomological dimension.\n\nWe are not to provide proof ideas, but we need to list statement targets that might be needed to proceed. For example:\n\n- A result that states that if Gamma is a uniform lattice in a semisimple Lie group, then it has a finite classifying space? Or that it is of type FL? \n- A result about the cohomological dimension of torsion-free subgroups and the effect of torsion.\n- A result about the existence of closed manifolds with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover, perhaps related to the problem of whether a group is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold.\n\nBut we must only list targets with likely sources.\n\nPossible statement targets:\n\n1. Needed statement: Every uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group is finitely presented and has a finite classifying space (or is of type F).\n   Likely source: Serre's \"Cohomologie des groupes discrets\" or Brown's \"Cohomology of Groups\", or the book by Bridson and Haefliger \"Metric spaces of non-positive curvature\".\n   Likely label or section: In Brown, Chapter VIII, Section 10 on \"Groups of type FL and duality\".\n\n2. Needed statement: For a group Gamma to be the fundamental group of a closed manifold with rationally acyclic universal cover, certain cohomological conditions must be satisfied, such as the cohomological dimension being equal to the dimension of the manifold, and the rational cohomology of Gamma being that of a point.\n   Likely source: Wall's \"Finiteness conditions for CW-complexes\" or Borel's \"Cohomologie réelle stable de groupes S-arithmétiques\".\n   Likely label or section: Not sure.\n\nBut we are to list only a few.\n\nGiven the problem is specific, we might need a statement about the existence of classifying spaces for groups with torsion, and the possibility of having a finite-dimensional model.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a known result that for certain lattices with torsion, there is no closed manifold with that fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. For example, if Gamma has torsion, then the cohomological dimension might be infinite, so no finite-dimensional classifying space exists. But uniform lattices in sem",

It is uniform (or cocompact) if G/Γ is compact.\n\n 2. **Real semisimple Lie group**: A connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is real and semisimple (no non-zero solvable ideals).\n\n 3. **2-torsion**: Elements of order 2 in the group.\n\n 4. **Rationally acyclic**: A space X is rationally acyclic if its reduced homology with rational coefficients is zero: H̃ₙ(X; ℚ) = 0 for all n.\n\n 5. **Universal cover**: The simply connected covering space.\n\n 6. **Fundamental group**: π₁(M).\n\n 7. **Compact manifold**: Usually means compact without boundary unless specified, but could be with boundary. The problem likely means closed manifold (compact without boundary) but I should flag this ambiguity.\n\n Key sources:\n - For lattices in Lie groups: Raghunathan \"Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups\", Zimmer \"Ergodic Theory and Semisimple Groups\", Margulis \"Discrete Subgroups of Semisimple Lie Groups\"\n - For rational acyclicity: Borel-Serre compactification, group cohomology Brown \"Cohomology of Groups\"\n - For manifolds with given fundamental group: Surgery theory, Wall's finiteness obstruction, but I should not suggest proofs.\n - Specific to rational acyclicity of universal covers: This relates to the homology of the group. If M̃ is rationally acyclic, then H*(Γ; ℚ) ≅ H*(pt; ℚ), meaning the rational cohomological dimension is 0, which is impossible for infinite groups unless... wait. Actually, if M is a compact manifold with π₁(M) = Γ, and M̃ is the universal cover, then H*(M̃; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; ℚ) if M is a K(Γ,1). But if M̃ is rationally acyclic, then H*(Γ; ℚ) = H*(pt; ℚ). But Γ is a uniform lattice in a semisimple Lie group, so it has nontrivial rational cohomology (the group cohomology H*(Γ; ℚ) is isomorphic to the cohomology of the locally symmetric space, which is nonzero). So the question is likely about whether there exists some M (not necessarily K(Γ,1)) with π₁(M) = Γ and M̃ rationally acyclic.\n\n Actually, the problem is likely related to the following: For a group Γ, does there exist a compact manifold M with π₁(M) ≅ Γ such that the universal cover M̃ is rationally acyclic? This is related to the Borel conjecture or to the existence of \"rational homology spheres\" with given fundamental group.\n\n But for lattices with torsion, there are constraints from Smith theory.\n\n Key references:\n - Smith theory: Borel \"Seminar on transformation groups\"\n - Rational acyclicity: Borel-Serre \"Corners and Arithmetic Groups\"\n - Finiteness obstruction: Wall \"Finiteness conditions for CW-complexes\"\n - Surgery theory: Wall \"Surgery on Compact Manifolds\", Ranicki \"Algebraic and Geometric Surgery\"\n\n Specific to the 2-torsion: Smith theory says that if a finite group acts on a finite-dimensional space with mod p homology of a point, then the group has periodic cohomology or something similar? Actually, Smith theory relates the homology of the fixed point set to the homology of the space for actions of p-groups.\n\n If Γ has 2-torsion, then the universal cover M̃ has an action of the finite group ℤ/2ℤ (subgroup of Γ). If M̃ is rationally acyclic, what does Smith theory say? Smith theory typically works with Z/p coefficients.\n\n Actually, the key issue might be: If M is a compact manifold with π₁(M) = Γ and M̃ is rationally acyclic, then the rational homology of M equals the rational homology of the group Γ. But M is a closed manifold, so it has Poincaré duality. So H*(Γ; ℚ) must satisfy Poincaré duality. For a uniform lattice Γ in a semisimple Lie group G of dimension n, the locally symmetric space Γ\\G/K is a closed aspherical manifold (if torsion-free), and its rational cohomology satisfies Poincaré duality. But if Γ has torsion, it's not a manifold.\n\n The question is asking about the existence of ANY compact manifold M with π₁(M) = Γ (not necessarily aspherical) such that M̃ is rationally acyclic.\n\n This is related to the \"rational homology manifold\" or \"rationally acyclic universal cover\" problem. The obstruction might come from the fact that if M̃ is rationally acyclic, then the group cohomology H*(Γ; ℚ) is the cohomology of a point, which contradicts the fact that Γ is a lattice (has cohomology in high degrees).\n\n Wait, no: If M is not aspherical, then H*(M; ℚ) ≠ H*(Γ; ℚ). The universal cover being rationally acyclic means H*(M̃; ℚ) = 0 for * > 0. By the Cartan-Leray spectral sequence (or group cohomology), H*(M; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; ℚ) if M̃ is contractible, but if M̃ is only rationally acyclic, we have H*(M; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; H*(M̃; ℚ)) = H*(Γ; ℚ). So H*(M; ℚ) ≅ H*(Γ; ℚ). But M is a compact manifold, so it has Poincaré duality. Therefore H*(Γ; ℚ) must satisfy Poincaré duality.\n\n For a uniform lattice Γ in a semisimple Lie group G, H*(Γ; ℚ) is isomorphic to the cohomology of the compact dual symmetric space (by Matsushima's formula and Borel's work), which is",

      "content": "We are given a problem about a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4 with all faces Lagrangian and 4 faces meeting at each vertex. The question is whether K admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets only. We are not to provide proof ideas or attempt to answer the problem.\n\nWe need to output strict JSON with keys: problem_id, core_definitions, statement_targets, minimal_dependency_set, ambiguity_flags, do_not_assume.\n\nFirst, identify the problem_id. It is given as \"Problem P08 context\", so we can set problem_id: \"P08\".\n\nNow, we need to provide core_definitions. We need to define terms that are central to the problem. The terms include:\n- Polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4.\n- Lagrangian faces.\n- 4 faces meeting at each vertex.\n- Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing.\n- K_t -> K (smoothing).\n\nWe need to provide formal definition candidates, confidence, and source candidates (likely references).\n\nWe also need statement_targets: likely statements from literature that are needed, e.g., definitions, theorems about Lagrangian smoothing, Hamiltonian isotopy, etc.\n\nMinimal_dependency_set: items that are critical to understand the problem, e.g., definitions of Lagrangian submanifolds, Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms, etc.\n\nAmbiguity_flags: any ambiguities in the problem statement.\n\nDo_not_assume: things we should not assume.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\nWe have a polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4. \"Polyhedral\" likely means it is a piecewise linear surface made of polygons (faces). \"Lagrangian\" means each face is a Lagrangian subspace or a Lagrangian submanifold? Actually, it says \"all faces Lagrangian\", so each face is a Lagrangian submanifold (or perhaps a linear Lagrangian subspace if the faces are flat). Since it is a polyhedral surface, the faces are likely flat polygons that are Lagrangian subspaces (i.e., linear subspaces that are Lagrangian with respect to the symplectic form). In R^4 with the standard symplectic form, a Lagrangian subspace is a 2-dimensional subspace on which the symplectic form vanishes. So each face is a flat Lagrangian disk (or polygon) lying in a Lagrangian plane.\n\nThe condition \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\" is a combinatorial condition: at every vertex, exactly four faces meet. This is like a condition on the polyhedral complex.\n\nThe question: does K admit a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K? This likely means: can we deform K through a family of Lagrangian submanifolds (via a Hamiltonian flow) to a smooth Lagrangian submanifold? Or more precisely, is there a Hamiltonian isotopy that smoothes out the polyhedral Lagrangian surface into a smooth Lagrangian surface? The notation K_t -> K might indicate that as t goes to 0, K_t converges to K, and for t>0, K_t is smooth.\n\nWe need to formalize these concepts.\n\nCore definitions:\n\n1. Polyhedral Lagrangian surface in R^4.\n   - Term: \"Polyhedral Lagrangian surface\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A polyhedral 2-dimensional surface in R^4 (possibly with boundary) such that each face (polygon) is contained in a Lagrangian affine subspace (i.e., the affine subspace is Lagrangian with respect to the standard symplectic form on R^4). Alternatively, each face is a Lagrangian submanifold (flat and Lagrangian).\n   - Confidence: Medium, because \"polyhedral\" might be interpreted in different ways (e.g., piecewise linear, simplicial, etc.). Also, \"Lagrangian\" for a face might mean that the face is a subset of a Lagrangian subspace.\n   - Source candidates: Standard references on symplectic geometry and Lagrangian submanifolds, e.g., McDuff and Salamon's \"Introduction to Symplectic Topology\", Arnold's \"Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics\". But for polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces, it might be more specialized, perhaps in papers on Lagrangian skeleta or singular Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n2. Lagrangian face.\n   - Term: \"Lagrangian face\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A face (polygon) of a polyhedral surface that lies in an affine Lagrangian subspace of R^4.\n   - Confidence: Medium.\n   - Source candidates: Same as above.\n\n3. Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing.\n   - Term: \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: A family of Lagrangian submanifolds {K_t} for t in (0,1] such that K_t is smooth for t>0, K_0 = K (the polyhedral surface), and the family is generated by a Hamiltonian flow. More precisely, there exists a smooth family of Hamiltonian functions H_t such that the time-t flow of the Hamiltonian vector field X_{H_t} takes K to K_t (or deforms K into K_t). Alternatively, K_t = φ_t(K) where φ_t is a Hamiltonian isotopy.\n   - Confidence: Medium, because smoothing might mean that K_t becomes a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, and the deformation is through Hamiltonian isotopy.\n   - Source candidates: McDuff and Salamon on Hamiltonian isotopies and Lagrangian submanifolds.\n\n4. 4 faces meeting at each vertex.\n   - Term: \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\"\n   - Formal definition candidate: At every vertex of the polyhedral surface, exactly four faces (2-dimensional cells) are incident.\n   - Confidence: High.\n   - Source candidates: Basic polyhedral geometry.\n\nWe might also need to define Lagrangian submanifold, Hamiltonian isotopy, etc.\n\nBut note: the problem says \"Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.\" So we should list the core definitions that are specific to the problem. Also, we need to provide source candidates (likely references).\n\nWe should also include definitions for standard terms if they are critical, but perhaps we can assume some background. However, the minimal_dependency_set should list items that are critical.\n\nLet's think about what is needed to understand the problem:\n\n- Symplectic manifold (R^4 with standard symplectic form).\n- Lagrangian submanifold (or subspace).\n- Polyhedral surface (piecewise linear).\n- Hamiltonian diffeomorphism/isotopy.\n- Smoothing of a polyhedral surface.\n\nWe need to provide these as core_definitions or in minimal_dependency_set.\n\nBut note: core_definitions is for terms that appear in the problem statement and need formal definition. The problem statement uses \"polyhedral Lagrangian surface\", \"faces Lagrangian\", \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\", \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\". So these are the terms to define.\n\nWe might also need to define \"Lagrangian smoothing\" without Hamiltonian? But the problem says \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\".\n\nWe should also consider ambiguity: What exactly is meant by \"polyhedral\"? Is it a simplicial complex? A CW complex? Are the faces polygons? Are they necessarily flat? Is the surface closed or with boundary? The problem says \"surface\", so likely a 2-dimensional polyhedral complex. Also, \"Lagrangian\" for a face: does it mean that the face is a Lagrangian submanifold with boundary? Since faces are polygons, they are flat, so they are Lagrangian if they lie in a Lagrangian plane.\n\nAnother ambiguity: The smoothing: is it required that K_t is Lagrangian for all t? And smooth for t>0? And the convergence is as what? As sets? In some topology?\n\nWe should flag these ambiguities.\n\nNow, statement_targets: We need to identify",

      "reasoning_content": "The user wants me to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and citation targets for a problem about polyhedral Lagrangian surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ and Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing. I need to output strict JSON with specific keys.\n\n Let me analyze the problem:\n 1. Polyhedral Lagrangian surface $K$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$\n 2. All faces are Lagrangian\n 3. 4 faces meeting at each vertex\n 4. Question: whether $K$ admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing $K_t \\to K$\n\n I need to provide:\n - Core definitions: terms like \"polyhedral Lagrangian surface\", \"Lagrangian face\", \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\"\n - Statement targets: theorems or results that would be needed\n - Minimal dependency set: what mathematical tools/concepts are critical\n - Ambiguity flags: unclear aspects\n - do_not_assume: things I shouldn't take for granted\n\n Key concepts to define:\n 1. Lagrangian submanifold (standard symplectic geometry)\n 2. Polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^4$\n 3. Lagrangian condition for polyhedral surfaces\n 4. Hamiltonian isotopy/smoothing\n 5. Convergence $K_t \\to K$\n 6. Singular Lagrangian surfaces\n\n Important sources to consider:\n - Symplectic geometry texts (McDuff-Salamon, Cannas da Silva)\n - Papers on Lagrangian surfaces with singularities\n - Audin, Lalonde, Sikorav work on Lagrangian submanifolds\n - Gromov's work on Lagrangian intersection theory\n - Specific papers on polyhedral or piecewise linear Lagrangians\n - Joyce's work on special Lagrangians with singularities (might be too specialized)\n - Stefan Nemirovski's work on Lagrangian embeddings and complexity\n\n Let me think about the specific definitions:\n\n 1. **Lagrangian submanifold**: In $(\\mathbb{R}^4, \\omega_0)$ where $\\omega_0 = dx_1 \\wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \\wedge dy_2$, a submanifold $L$ is Lagrangian if $\\dim L = 2$ and $\\omega_0|_L = 0$.\n\n 2. **Polyhedral Lagrangian**: A piecewise linear (or piecewise smooth) surface where each face is Lagrangian. This means each face is a 2-dimensional polygon (or smooth disk) with the Lagrangian condition holding on the interior.\n\n 3. **Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing**: A 1-parameter family $K_t$ of smooth Lagrangian submanifolds converging to $K$ as $t \\to 0$, where the convergence is in some appropriate topology (Hausdorff? Currents?), and each $K_t$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a standard form, or the smoothing is realized via Hamiltonian isotopy.\n\n Wait, the phrase \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" is ambiguous. It could mean:\n - A smoothing $K_t$ where each $K_t$ is Lagrangian and the family is generated by a Hamiltonian function\n - Or a smoothing that is \"Hamiltonian\" in the sense of being isotopic through Hamiltonian deformations\n\n Actually, looking at the notation $K_t \\to K$, this suggests a convergence of submanifolds. The term \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" likely refers to a smooth family of Lagrangian submanifolds $K_t$ converging to the singular object $K$, where the convergence is regular enough.\n\n 4. **Vertex condition**: 4 faces meeting at each vertex. This suggests a combinatorial condition. In a polyhedral surface, normally edges meet at vertices. If 4 faces meet at a vertex, this is a specific local combinatorial structure.\n\n Actually, for a surface, faces meet along edges. At a vertex, multiple faces meet. If 4 faces meet at each vertex, this means the link of the vertex consists of 4 points (so the vertex is a \"flat\" point combinatorially?).\n\n Wait, let me reconsider: A polyhedral surface in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ has:\n - 2-dimensional faces\n - 1-dimensional edges (intersection of two faces)\n - 0-dimensional vertices\n\n At a vertex $v$, several faces meet. The condition \"4 faces meeting at each vertex\" means exactly 4 faces have $v$ as a boundary point.\n\n This is a very specific condition. In a generic polyhedral surface in 4-space, the number of faces meeting at a vertex could vary.\n\n Potential sources:\n - \"Lagrangian submanifolds of $\\mathbb{C}^n$\" by Audin\n - \"Symplectic geometry\" by McDuff and Salamon\n - \"Introduction to symplectic and Hamiltonian geometry\" by Cannas da Silva\n - Papers by Eliashberg, Gromov on Lagrangian intersection theory\n - \"The topology of Lagrangian submanifolds\" - various authors\n - Recent work on \"flexible\" vs \"rigid\" Lagrangians\n\n Specific to polyhedral Lagrangians:\n - There might be work by Sauvaget, or by Dimitroglou Rizell\n - \"Piecewise linear Lagrangian submanifolds\" might be a specific topic\n\n Let me think about the technical definitions needed:\n\n **Symplectic form on $\\mathbb{R}^4$**: $\\omega = \\sum_{i=1}^2 dx_i \\wedge dy_i$.\n\n **Lagrangian condition**: For a smooth submanifold $L^2 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^4$, $\\omega|_L = 0$ and $\\dim L = 2$.\n\n **Polyhedral surface**: A topological surface $K$ embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ (or immersed) with a cell decomposition such that each 2-cell (face) is mapped as a polygon (linear or smooth) in $\\mathbb{R}^4$.\n\n **Lagrangian faces**: Each face $F$ satisfies $\\omega|_F = 0$. Since $F$ is 2-dimensional and linear (or contained in an affine 2-plane), this means the affine 2-plane containing $F$ must be Lagrangian.\n\n **Hamiltonian smoothing**: This is the delicate part. One needs:\n 1. Definition of smoothing of singular Lagrangians\n 2. Hamiltonian isotopy classes\n 3. Lagrangian neighborhood theorems (Weinstein)\n\n The question seems to be asking whether a polyhedral Lagrangian can be approximated by smooth Lagrangians via Hamiltonian isotopies or whether there exists a smooth family $K_t$ of Lagrangian submanifolds converging to $K$.\n\n Actually, \"Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing\" might refer to:\n - A smooth family $\\{K_t\\}_{t>0}$ of Lagrangian submanifolds\n - Such that $K_t \\to K$ as $t \\to 0$ (in Hausdorff topology, or as currents)\n - And the family is Hamiltonian in the sense that $K_t = \\phi_t(K_1)$ for a Hamiltonian isotopy $\\phi_t$ (but this doesn't make sense as $t \\to 0$)\n - OR: The smoothing is achieved by a Hamiltonian vector field flow\n\n Actually, looking at standard terminology: A \"Hamiltonian smoothing\" usually means smoothing via Hamiltonian isotopy. But since $K$ is singular and $K_t",
