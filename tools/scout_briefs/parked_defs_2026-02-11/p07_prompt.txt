You are assisting a math workflow under strict contamination controls.
Task: Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.
Do NOT provide proof ideas, proof sketches, route strategies, or attempt to answer the problem.
If uncertain, mark uncertainty explicitly.

Output STRICT JSON with keys:
- problem_id
- core_definitions: [{term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates:[...]}]
- statement_targets: [{needed_statement, likely_source, likely_label_or_section, confidence}]
- minimal_dependency_set: [{item, why_critical, confidence}]
- ambiguity_flags: [string]
- do_not_assume: [string]

Problem P07 context:
- Gamma is a uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group, with 2-torsion.
- Ask whether there exists compact manifold M with pi_1(M)=Gamma and universal cover M~ rationally acyclic.
Need clean formal definitions and citation targets only.
