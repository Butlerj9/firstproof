You are assisting a math workflow under strict contamination controls.
Task: Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.
Do NOT provide proof ideas, proof sketches, route strategies, or attempt to answer the problem.
If uncertain, mark uncertainty explicitly.

Output STRICT JSON with keys:
- problem_id
- core_definitions: [{term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates:[...]}]
- statement_targets: [{needed_statement, likely_source, likely_label_or_section, confidence}]
- minimal_dependency_set: [{item, why_critical, confidence}]
- ambiguity_flags: [string]
- do_not_assume: [string]

Problem P08 context:
- Polyhedral Lagrangian surface K in R^4 (all faces Lagrangian), 4 faces meeting at each vertex.
- Ask whether K admits a Hamiltonian Lagrangian smoothing K_t -> K.
Need clean formal definitions and citation targets only.
