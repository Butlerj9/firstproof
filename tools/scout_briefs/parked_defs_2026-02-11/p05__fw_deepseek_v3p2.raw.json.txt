        "content": "We are given a problem context about a finite group G, an incomplete transfer system O associated to an N\u221e operad, and two needs: \n 1. Define O-adapted slice filtration on G-equivariant stable category.\n 2. Characterize O-slice connectivity of a connective G-spectrum via geometric fixed points.\n\n We are to provide only candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets.\n\n We are not to provide proof ideas, strategies, etc.\n\n We are to output in strict JSON format with specified keys.\n\n Steps:\n 1. Identify the problem_id: We are given \"Problem P05 context\", so problem_id is \"P05\".\n 2. core_definitions: We need to define terms that are central to the problem. \n    Terms might include: \n      - Finite group G (assumed known, but we can note it)\n      - Incomplete transfer system O associated to an N\u221e operad.\n      - O-adapted slice filtration.\n      - G-equivariant stable category.\n      - O-slice connectivity.\n      - Connective G-spectrum.\n      - Geometric fixed points.\n\n    For each term, we provide a formal definition candidate, confidence, and source candidates (likely references).\n\n 3. statement_targets: We need to identify statements (theorems, definitions) that are needed to proceed. \n    For example, the definition of O-adapted slice filtration and the characterization of O-slice connectivity via geometric fixed points.\n\n 4. minimal_dependency_set: What are the minimal dependencies (e.g., definitions, theorems) that are critical to the problem?\n\n 5. ambiguity_flags: Any ambiguities in the problem statement or context.\n\n 6. do_not_assume: Things we should not assume.\n\n Since the problem is about equivariant homotopy theory and uses concepts from recent work on N\u221e operads and slice filtrations, we should look for sources like:\n   - The work of Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel on the slice filtration (for the equivariant stable category).\n   - Work on N\u221e operads by Blumberg and Hill, and others.\n   - Possibly recent work on incomplete transfer systems and adapted slice filtrations.\n\n However, note that the problem mentions \"incomplete transfer system O associated to an N\u221e operad\". This might be from recent work on generalized slice filtrations.\n\n Let's break down:\n\n Core definitions:\n\n Term: \"Incomplete transfer system O\"\n   Formal definition candidate: An incomplete transfer system on a finite group G is a collection of subgroups of G that is closed under conjugation and contains the trivial subgroup, but not necessarily all subgroups. It is associated to an N\u221e operad, which encodes compatible multiplicative norm maps for the subgroups in the transfer system.\n   Confidence: medium, because the exact definition might vary. We are not given the group G, but it's finite.\n   Source candidates: [Blumberg-Hill, \"N\u221e operads and parametrized spectra\", 2015; Blumberg-Hill, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 2017]\n\n Term: \"O-adapted slice filtration\"\n   Formal definition candidate: An O-adapted slice filtration on the G-equivariant stable category is a filtration of G-spectra that is adapted to the transfer system O, meaning that the filtration respects the norm maps encoded by O. It is a generalization of the classical slice filtration (for complete transfer systems) to incomplete ones.\n   Confidence: low, because this is a specialized concept and we don't have a precise definition at hand.\n   Source candidates: [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, \"On the non-existence of elements of Kervaire invariant one\", 2016; recent work on generalized slice filtrations by Hill, Hopkins, and others]\n\n Term: \"G-equivariant stable category\"\n   Formal definition candidate: The category of G-spectra, which is the stable homotopy category of genuine G-equivariant spectra.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986; Mandell-May, \"Equivariant orthogonal spectra and S-modules\", 2002]\n\n Term: \"O-slice connectivity\"\n   Formal definition candidate: A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice n-connected if its n-th slice in the O-adapted slice filtration is contractible, or equivalently, if it lies in the non-negative part of the O-adapted slice filtration.\n   Confidence: low, because we are extrapolating from the classical slice connectivity.\n   Source candidates: [Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel, \"On the non-existence of elements of Kervaire invariant one\", 2016]\n\n Term: \"Connective G-spectrum\"\n   Formal definition candidate: A G-spectrum X is connective if its homotopy groups (or Mackey functor homotopy groups) are zero in negative degrees.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986]\n\n Term: \"Geometric fixed points\"\n   Formal definition candidate: For a G-spectrum X, the geometric fixed points \u03a6^H(X) for a subgroup H of G is the H-fixed points of the H-geometric fixed point spectrum of X, which is a non-equivariant spectrum.\n   Confidence: high, this is standard.\n   Source candidates: [Lewis-May-Steinberger, \"Equivariant stable homotopy theory\", 1986]\n\n However, note that the problem asks for a characterization via geometric fixed points. So we might need a theorem that relates O-slice connectivity to the connectivity of geometric fixed points.\n\n Statement targets:\n\n We need two main statements:\n   1. The definition of the O-adapted slice filtration.\n   2. A theorem that characterizes O-slice connectivity in terms of geometric fixed points.\n\n For the first, we look for a source that defines the O-adapted slice filtration. Possibly in recent work by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel, or follow-ups.\n\n For the second, we look for a theorem that says something like: A connective G-spectrum X is O-slice n-connected if and only if for every subgroup H in the transfer system O (or perhaps every subgroup of G?), the geometric fixed points \u03a6^H(X) are n-connected.\n\n Minimal dependency set:\n\n We need:\n   - The definition of the G-equivariant stable category (to work in the right category).\n   - The definition of an incomplete transfer system O (to know which norms are available).\n   - The definition of the O-adapted slice filtration (the main object).\n   - The definition of geometric fixed points (for the characterization).\n\n Ambiguity flags:\n   - The problem does not specify the group G beyond being finite. The definitions might depend on the group.\n   - The transfer system O is incomplete, so we don't have norms for all subgroups. How exactly does the slice filtration adapt to O?\n   - The characterization via geometric fixed points: which subgroups do we take geometric fixed points for? All subgroups? Only those in O? Only certain ones?\n\n Do not assume:\n   - We should not assume that the transfer system O is complete (i.e., contains all subgroups).\n   - We should not assume that the O-adapted slice filtration is the same as the classical slice filtration.\n\n Let's structure the output accordingly.\n\n Note: We are to provide only candidate definitions and citation targets. We are not to prove or elaborate.\n\n We'll use the following structure for the JSON:\n\n {\n   \"problem_id\": \"P05\",\n   \"core_definitions\": [\n     { \"term\": \"incomplete transfer system O\", \n       \"formal_definition_candidate\":"
