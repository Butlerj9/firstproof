You are assisting a math workflow under strict contamination controls.
Task: Provide ONLY candidate formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets needed to proceed.
Do NOT provide proof ideas, proof sketches, route strategies, or attempt to answer the problem.
If uncertain, mark uncertainty explicitly.

Output STRICT JSON with keys:
- problem_id
- core_definitions: [{term, formal_definition_candidate, confidence, source_candidates:[...]}]
- statement_targets: [{needed_statement, likely_source, likely_label_or_section, confidence}]
- minimal_dependency_set: [{item, why_critical, confidence}]
- ambiguity_flags: [string]
- do_not_assume: [string]

Problem P02 context:
- Non-archimedean local field F.
- Generic irreducible admissible Pi of GL_{n+1}(F), generic irreducible admissible pi of GL_n(F).
- Whittaker models W(Pi, psi^{-1}) and W(pi, psi), additive character psi with conductor o.
- Conductor ideal q of pi, Q generates q^{-1}, u_Q = I_{n+1} + Q E_{n,n+1}.
- Integral: int_{N_n\GL_n(F)} W(diag(g,1) u_Q) V(g) |det g|^{s-1/2} dg.
Need clean formal definitions and citation targets only.
