Response:
We are given a problem about a uniform lattice Gamma in a real semisimple Lie group, with 2-torsion. The question is whether there exists a compact manifold M with fundamental group pi_1(M)=Gamma and universal cover M~ rationally acyclic. We need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or strategies. We need to output in strict JSON format with keys: problem_id, core_definitions, statement_targets, minimal_dependency_set, ambiguity_flags, do_not_assume. First, identify the problem: It is about existence of a compact manifold with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. The group is a uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group, and it has 2-torsion. We need to define: - uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group - 2-torsion (in a group) - rationally acyclic (for a space) - compact manifold (but that is standard) Also, we need to clarify notation: Gamma, M, M~. We need to provide candidate formal definitions and source citations. For definitions, we can refer to standard textbooks on Lie groups, lattices, and algebraic topology. Core definitions: 1.
