        "content": "We are given a problem about a uniform lattice Gamma in a real semisimple Lie group, with 2-torsion. We are asked whether there exists a compact manifold M with fundamental group pi_1(M)=Gamma and universal cover M~ rationally acyclic.\n\nWe need to provide formal definitions, notation clarifications, and primary-source citation targets. We are not to provide proof ideas or answer the problem.\n\nWe need to output JSON with specific keys.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Gamma is a uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group.\n2. Gamma has 2-torsion.\n3. We are to consider the existence of a compact manifold M such that pi_1(M) = Gamma and the universal cover M~ is rationally acyclic.\n\nWe need to define:\n- Uniform lattice\n- Real semisimple Lie group\n- 2-torsion (in the context of a group)\n- Rationally acyclic (for a space)\n\nAlso, we might need to clarify what is meant by \"universal cover M~ rationally acyclic\".\n\nWe need to provide candidate formal definitions and source candidates (likely from standard references in Lie groups, geometric group theory, and algebraic topology).\n\nWe also need to identify statement targets: what statements from the literature might be relevant? For example, there might be known results about the existence of such manifolds for certain groups, or obstructions.\n\nBut note: we are only to provide citation targets, not proof strategies.\n\nWe also need to list minimal dependency set: what are the critical concepts or theorems that are necessary to even state the problem precisely?\n\nAmbiguity flags: any ambiguities in the problem statement.\n\nDo not assume: things we should not assume.\n\nLet's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, problem_id: given as P07.\n\nCore definitions:\n\nWe need to define:\n- Uniform lattice\n- Real semisimple Lie group\n- 2-torsion\n- Rationally acyclic\n\nWe'll provide for each: term, formal definition candidate, confidence, and source candidates.\n\n1. Term: Uniform lattice\n   Formal definition candidate: A discrete subgroup Gamma of a locally compact group G is a lattice if the quotient space G/Gamma has finite Haar measure. If in addition G/Gamma is compact, then Gamma is called a uniform lattice.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Margulis' book \"Discrete Subgroups of Semisimple Lie Groups\", Raghunathan's book \"Discrete Subgroups of Lie Groups\", or Zimmer's book \"Ergodic Theory and Semisimple Groups\"]\n\n2. Term: Real semisimple Lie group\n   Formal definition candidate: A real Lie group is semisimple if its Lie algebra is semisimple, i.e., it is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras (with no nonzero abelian ideal). Alternatively, a connected Lie group is semisimple if it has trivial radical (the largest connected solvable normal subgroup).\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Knapp's \"Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction\", Helgason's \"Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces\"]\n\n3. Term: 2-torsion\n   Formal definition candidate: A group Gamma has 2-torsion if there exists an element g in Gamma, g \u2260 identity, such that g^2 = identity.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Standard group theory references, e.g., Rotman's \"An Introduction to the Theory of Groups\"]\n\n4. Term: Rationally acyclic\n   Formal definition candidate: A topological space X is rationally acyclic if its reduced rational homology groups are trivial, i.e., H_i(X; Q) = 0 for all i > 0. For the universal cover M~, we require that H_i(M~; Q) = 0 for all i > 0.\n   Confidence: High\n   Source candidates: [Hatcher's \"Algebraic Topology\", Spanier's \"Algebraic Topology\"]\n\nWe might also need to define \"compact manifold\" but that is standard.\n\nStatement targets: We need to identify statements from the literature that might be relevant. For example, there might be known results about when a group can be the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold, or about the existence of closed manifolds with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. Possibly related to the Singer conjecture or the Baum-Connes conjecture. But we are only to provide likely sources and labels.\n\nGiven the problem is about uniform lattices in semisimple Lie groups, one might look at results about cohomological dimension, duality properties, and the existence of classifying spaces. For example, if Gamma is a torsion-free lattice, then it is known that Gamma is the fundamental group of a closed locally symmetric space, and the universal cover is the symmetric space, which is contractible. But here Gamma has torsion, so it cannot act freely on a contractible manifold. However, the problem asks for a compact manifold M with pi_1(M)=Gamma, but the universal cover M~ is rationally acyclic, not necessarily contractible. So we are looking for a manifold M whose universal cover has trivial rational homology.\n\nThere might be known obstructions from group cohomology. For instance, if Gamma has torsion, then the cohomological dimension of Gamma might be infinite, but that doesn't necessarily preclude the existence of a finite-dimensional classifying space. However, if Gamma is a lattice with torsion, it might still have a finite classifying space? There are results about virtual cohomological dimension.\n\nWe are not to provide proof ideas, but we need to list statement targets that might be needed to proceed. For example:\n\n- A result that states that if Gamma is a uniform lattice in a semisimple Lie group, then it has a finite classifying space? Or that it is of type FL? \n- A result about the cohomological dimension of torsion-free subgroups and the effect of torsion.\n- A result about the existence of closed manifolds with given fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover, perhaps related to the problem of whether a group is the fundamental group of a closed aspherical manifold.\n\nBut we must only list targets with likely sources.\n\nPossible statement targets:\n\n1. Needed statement: Every uniform lattice in a real semisimple Lie group is finitely presented and has a finite classifying space (or is of type F).\n   Likely source: Serre's \"Cohomologie des groupes discrets\" or Brown's \"Cohomology of Groups\", or the book by Bridson and Haefliger \"Metric spaces of non-positive curvature\".\n   Likely label or section: In Brown, Chapter VIII, Section 10 on \"Groups of type FL and duality\".\n\n2. Needed statement: For a group Gamma to be the fundamental group of a closed manifold with rationally acyclic universal cover, certain cohomological conditions must be satisfied, such as the cohomological dimension being equal to the dimension of the manifold, and the rational cohomology of Gamma being that of a point.\n   Likely source: Wall's \"Finiteness conditions for CW-complexes\" or Borel's \"Cohomologie r\u00e9elle stable de groupes S-arithm\u00e9tiques\".\n   Likely label or section: Not sure.\n\nBut we are to list only a few.\n\nGiven the problem is specific, we might need a statement about the existence of classifying spaces for groups with torsion, and the possibility of having a finite-dimensional model.\n\nAlternatively, there might be a known result that for certain lattices with torsion, there is no closed manifold with that fundamental group and rationally acyclic universal cover. For example, if Gamma has torsion, then the cohomological dimension might be infinite, so no finite-dimensional classifying space exists. But uniform lattices in sem"
