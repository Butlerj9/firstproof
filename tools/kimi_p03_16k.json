The leading homogeneous component of $E^*_{\\lambda^-}$ is the standard Macdonald polynomial $E_{\\lambda^-}(x;1,t)$, which is symmetric by the Alexandersson-Sawhney result; therefore $\\deg(d) < |\\lambda| = \\binom{n+1}{2}-1$. The polynomial $d(x;t)$ vanishes at all spectral vectors $\\bar{\\mu} = (t^{\\mu_1+n-1}, \\dots, t^{\\mu_n})$ for compositions $\\mu$ satisfying $|\\mu| < |\\lambda|$. Since the number of such compositions equals $\\binom{|\\lambda|+n-1}{n}$ which is strictly greater than the dimension of the space of non-symmetric polynomials of degree $< |\\lambda|$, and the spectral vectors are distinct for generic $t$, it follows that $d(x;t) \\equiv 0$.",

Then verify that $d(\\bar{\\mu};t) = 0$ for all compositions $\\mu$ of weight $4$ (there are $15$ such compositions). This involves $15$ evaluations of a degree-4 polynomial in $3$ variables, which is computationally trivial.",
      "failure_mode": "The degree of $d(x;t)$ is not strictly less than $|\\lambda|$ (i.e., the lower-degree corrections are not symmetric), or the vanishing at the $15$ points does not force the polynomial to be zero due to algebraic dependencies among the spectral vectors at $q=1$.",

At $q=1$, for the specific weight $|\\lambda| = \\binom{n+1}{2}-1$, the set of tableaux contributing to the sum is in bijection with permutations $\\sigma \\in S_n$ acting on a base tableau, and the weights $\\psi_T(1,t)$ become symmetric under this action, forcing the total sum to be symmetric in $x$.",

Compute the sum using the explicit weight formula from Knop-Sahi (Theorem 1.1 of 'A recursion formula for Macdonald polynomials', 1997) specialized to $q=1$, and verify that the resulting rational function in $t$ and polynomial in $x$ is symmetric under swapping $x_1 \\leftrightarrow x_2$.",
