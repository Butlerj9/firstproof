FAILURE-CONDITIONED SCOUT PROMPT — P03 (Algebraic Combinatorics)
================================================================

## Exact Target Claim

The Symmetry Conjecture: For all n >= 1 and all partitions λ of weight n(n+1)/2 - 1, the interpolation (Knop-Sahi) non-symmetric Macdonald polynomial E*_{λ⁻}(x; q=1, t) is symmetric in x₁,...,xₙ.

Here λ⁻ is the anti-dominant permutation (reverse-sorted) of the partition λ.

## Critical Disambiguation (must honor)

Do NOT conflate:
1) direct specialization E*_{λ⁻}(x; q=1, t), and
2) the lane object f* defined by the q -> 1 limit used in existing P03 proofs.

Any claim that depends on this distinction must state explicitly which object is being used.

## Proved Scope

- n=2: Symbolic proof (direct computation, 2 variables)
- n=3: PROVED via degree-bound + zero test. The symmetry difference d(t) = E*_{λ⁻}(x;1,t) - E*_{λ⁻}(σx;1,t) is a rational function of t with total degree ≤ 20. Evaluated at 82 exact t-values, all give d(t)=0. Since 82 > 20, d(t) ≡ 0.
- n=4: PROVED via modular arithmetic. Degree bound 54 (pattern 6×(9-d)). Evaluated at 90 rational t-values modulo two independent primes (~10^8). All give 0 mod both primes. Since 90 > 54, d(t) ≡ 0.

## Unresolved Blocker (single sentence)

For n ≥ 5, the perturbation system is ~11K × 11K with degree bound 112, requiring ~247 days of single-threaded computation — no algebraic shortcut has been found to bypass this computational barrier.

Equivalent structural blocker:
For n ≥ 5, the missing ingredient is a proof (or disproof) that the lower-degree interpolation corrections selected by the q -> 1 limit mechanism are symmetric.

## Failed Approaches (8 total, with reason each failed)

1. **Symbolic-t perturbation (SymPy)**: SymPy too slow at perturbation order ≥ 4 for n=3 (49-dimensional null space). Does not scale.
2. **Rational Richardson extrapolation**: Insufficient convergence rate for the q→1 limit. Extrapolation error does not decrease reliably.
3. **Thiele continued fraction**: Poles appear in reciprocal differences, making the continued fraction representation ill-conditioned.
4. **S_n equivariance quotient**: Reduces from 11K to ~324 partition-indexed blocks at n=5, but per-block cost is still O(324³ × deg_bound) which remains prohibitive (~65 days).
5. **Spectral vector collapse at q=1**: The spectral vectors remain distinct at generic t, so no simplification from degenerate eigenvalue structure.
6. **Restriction x_n → 0**: Gives wrong implication direction — symmetry of the restriction does not imply symmetry of the original polynomial.
7. **Hecke algebra degeneration**: At q=1, H_n(q,t) → C[S_n]. Symmetry is emergent (from vanishing conditions), not structural (from representation theory). The Hecke algebra alone cannot force it.
8. **Null space structure**: The null space has dimension n! at q=1, and S_n acts on it. The perturbation equations force non-trivial isotypic components to vanish. This EXPLAINS why the conjecture holds but provides NO computational shortcut.

## Additional structural lead (partially successful)

**Alexandersson-Sawhney (arXiv:1801.04550)**: The STANDARD non-symmetric Macdonald polynomial E_μ(x;1,t) is symmetric and t-independent for partitions μ. Via Hecke extension, ALL E_μ(x;1,t) are symmetric. This means the LEADING HOMOGENEOUS COMPONENT of E*_{λ⁻} is symmetric for all n. But the INTERPOLATION polynomial E* differs from the standard E by lower-degree correction terms (from vanishing conditions at spectral vectors). These corrections are NOT covered by the AS result.

The conjecture thus REDUCES to: "the inhomogeneous lower-degree corrections in E*_{λ⁻}(q=1,t) are symmetric."

## Hard Constraints

- No web searching for solutions to competition problems
- Statement-level citations only (CITE_ONLY) for published results
- No human mathematical input
- Any proposed approach must be FALSIFIABLE: state a specific lemma that can be tested computationally for small n

## What Counts as Success

ONE of:
(a) A bridge lemma that proves the lower-degree corrections of E*_{λ⁻}(q=1,t) are symmetric for all n, using structural properties of the Knop-Sahi vanishing conditions
(b) A counterexample: a specific partition λ and n ≥ 5 where E*_{λ⁻}(x;1,t) is NOT symmetric (this would disprove the conjecture)
(c) A citation to a published theorem that directly implies the conjecture
(d) An algebraic identity or recursion that reduces the n-variable computation to lower n

## Request

Propose exactly 3 new approaches that are NOT variants of the 8 failed routes above. For each approach, provide:
1. First bridge lemma (precise mathematical statement)
2. Falsifiable test (what to compute at n=3 or n=4 to check). Must be runnable in ≤ 30 minutes on a single CPU.
3. Likely failure mode
4. Required external theorem statement (if any). If no known theorem is needed, write "no_known_theorem". Do NOT invent or hallucinate citations.
5. Confidence (0-100) and novelty score (0-10 vs the 8 failed routes)
6. Anti-duplication check: one sentence explaining why this is NOT a variant of any of the 8 failed routes listed above (reference by number).
