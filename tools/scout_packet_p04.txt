FAILURE-CONDITIONED SCOUT PROMPT — P04 (Finite Free Convolution)
================================================================

## Exact Target Claim

Prove the remaining `n=4` case of the finite-free Fisher-information inequality in the lane's canonical formulation:

`1/Phi_4(p boxplus_4 q) >= 1/Phi_4(p) + 1/Phi_4(q)`

for monic real-rooted quartics in the unresolved regime `b != 0` and `c' != 0`, on the **CE-19 corrected valid domain**.

Use lane definitions for `Phi_4`/margin objects as canonical; do not substitute alternative definitions.

## Proved Scope (already closed)

- `n=2`: proved.
- `n=3`: proved.
- `n=4, b=0`: proved (CE-16).
- `n=4, c'=0`: proved (CE-26).

## Current Frontier

General `n=4` unresolved:
- CE-28/29 found a promising convexity/discriminant chain empirically.
- CE-30 found `M''(0)` structure and `phi`-subadditivity reduction.
- symbolic closure still blocked by high-complexity positivity objects (including degree-34 / 1612-term form and constrained-certificate gaps).

## Unresolved Blocker (single sentence)

No checkable symbolic/certified proof currently establishes the missing chain pieces (`M'' >= kappa > 0` and `2*kappa*M(0) >= M'(0)^2`) on the full corrected domain for the general `n=4` case.

## Hard Constraints

- Do not re-solve already closed subcases.
- Do not regress to pre-CE-19 invalid-domain assumptions.
- No web searching for direct competition solutions.
- Statement-level citation only for external theorems.
- Any proposed route must be falsifiable with a bounded kill-test.

## What Counts as Success

ONE of:
(a) A bridge lemma that closes one of the two missing chain steps with a checkable proof plan.
(b) A rigorous certification path (sparse SOS/SONC/CAD/interval) with concrete acceptance criteria.
(c) A concrete counterexample candidate in the corrected domain.
(d) A published theorem that directly implies the unresolved step.

## Request

Propose exactly 3 new approaches that are NOT variants of previously failed routes.
For each approach provide:
1. First bridge lemma (precise statement)
2. Falsifiable kill-test (<=30 min single CPU)
3. Likely failure mode
4. Required external theorem statement (or `no_known_theorem`)
5. Confidence (0-100) and novelty (0-10)
6. Anti-duplication statement (why it is not a variant)
