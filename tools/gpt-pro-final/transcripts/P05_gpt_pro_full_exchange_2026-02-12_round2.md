# GPT-pro Full Exchange — P05 (Round 2, Reclassified Copy)

Date captured: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided process trace + map + verdict (manual paste; copied from Claude folder due source-label ambiguity)  
Lane: P05  
Purpose: Preserve second-round research escalation and its new bridge-lemma claim.

## 1) Main response artifact

Primary round-2 response archive:
- `tools/gpt-pro-final/transcripts/P05_gpt_pro_response_2026-02-12_round2.md`

Round-2 novel claim:
- A local geometric-layer obstruction is removed via a fixed-point-free representation-sphere triviality lemma after geometric localization.

## 2) Process trace characteristics (as provided)

The trace includes:
1. local file parsing and lane-packet extraction,
2. targeted review of Class II minimal case (`Z/4`) and route-T obstruction,
3. broad search expansion with mixed-quality results (many irrelevant links),
4. final synthesis into a map, lane verdict table, and a 48-hour plan.

---

## 3) Contamination/escalation interpretation

This run has broad retrieval noise and mixed source quality:
1. treat all imported claims as provisional until source-verified in primary references,
2. do not use low-quality secondary links for theorem-level claims,
3. preserve only the mathematically checkable local lemma/corollary path unless verified.

Suggested contamination discipline for this round:
1. keep trusted core references only (e.g., HY and primary lane documents),
2. quarantine noisy source list items unless independently verified,
3. log what was adopted vs discarded.

## 4) Integration status

- Round-2 output sharpens P05 frontier and introduces a useful local lemma.
- It does not close Class II globally.
- Status remains unchanged absent a proof of the proper-isotropy lifting lemma.
