# GPT-pro Prompt — P05 Only

You are GPT-pro focusing ONLY on P05 (ignore P03/P04 entirely).

Primary objective:
Close P05 if solvable now, or produce a rigorous frontier certificate for the exact blocker.

Shared assumptions for this lane-only run:
- Portfolio state: 7 Submitted, 3 Candidate.
- This run is SINGLE-LANE only; do not spend output on other lanes.
- Time is not a limiting factor; exhaust approach families before declaring blocked.
- No overclaiming; tag every claim as Proved/Cited/Empirical/Unresolved.
- No invented citations; use no_known_theorem if needed.
- Prior failed routes are hard constraints (no repackaged variants).
- If web retrieval is used, limit to foundational theorem statements/definitions and log sources.

P05 known blocker:
- 7 theorems proved + frontier theorem.
- Remaining gap: Class II "if" direction.
- Multiple approaches blocked by non-uniform fixed-point dimensions for non-regular cells.

Execution protocol:
1) Failure map: exact unresolved statement + minimal blocking lemma.
2) Generate >=12 candidate approach families (>=4 cross-domain analogical transfers).
3) Novelty/viability gate: keep only non-variants of failed routes.
4) Keep top 3; provide proof skeleton + earliest fail-point + fallback bridge lemma.
5) Verdict: CLOSEABLE_NOW or BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER.
6) 48-hour ranked plan with stop-loss criteria.

```
you can use "off-limits" potential contamination sources as a last resort. the authors say the foundational proofs aren't available, so if you have to expand your search horizons to solve, it then do it. it's better to solve it eventually with all available tools than to leave it unsolved and some tools not used. we just have to document the level of contamination and the escalation reasoning.

SECTION A: Lane Verdict Table
Lane	StatusBefore	BestNewBridgeLemma	KillTest	Verdict	Why
P05	🟡 Candidate (7 theorems; Class II “if” open)	Bridge Lemma (target): Localized O‑t‑structure for non‑regular cells: For Class II systems, the Z/H‑local subcategory generated by spheres S^{k·ind_K^H(1)} (K≠1) forms the left half of a t‑structure detected by Φ^H with slope ν_O^eff(H).	Attempt to construct counterexample on smallest Class II case (G=Z/4, O={Z/2≤OZ/4}) satisfying Φ-connectivity but failing O-slice membership; OR derive localized t-structure via isotropy separation. Both exhausted → reduce to non-uniform RO(G)-shift obstruction.	BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER	All approach families reduce to a single structural gap: non‑uniform fixed‑point dimensions of non‑regular permutation representations; no counterexample found; no known theorem implies required localized t‑structure; obstruction persists in minimal case.

SECTION B: Actionable Plan
1) Top 3 Novel Approaches (non-variants of prior 5+ attempts)

Below are filtered for non-variant status relative to: (i) global t-structure attempt, (ii) orbit/Postnikov induction, (iii) geometric FP detection, (iv) norm/restriction adjunction, (v) isotropy separation reduction, plus scout proposals already reduced to same obstruction.
A1. Bredon–Euler Class Detection Lemma (Obstruction-Splitting Approach)

Idea
Exploit that for Class II systems, the problematic generators are permutation reps V = ind_K^H(1) with K≠1. These have nontrivial Euler class e(V) in RO(G)-graded Bredon cohomology. Hypothesis: multiplication by e(V) detects precisely the O-slice obstruction.

Target Bridge Lemma
If Φ^L(E) satisfies the ν_O^eff connectivity bounds, then e(V)^k annihilates the relevant RO(G)-graded homotopy Mackey functors below degree n, forcing E into τ_{≥n}^O.

Earliest fail-point
Need functorial control of Euler class action on geometric fixed points across all L simultaneously. Non-uniformity of dim(V^L) reappears as different vanishing slopes.

Fallback micro-lemma
Show that for minimal Class II case (Z/4), multiplication by e(1⊕χ) splits isotropy separation fiber, reducing to regular case after inverting e(χ).

Status: Unresolved; no_known_theorem guaranteeing such uniform Euler control.
A2. Weight-Structure (Not t-Structure) Replacement

Idea
Instead of forcing τ_{≥n}^O to be a t-structure (blocked), attempt a weight structure (Bondarko-style) on Sp^G localized at O. Weight structures require different orthogonality axioms and may tolerate non-uniform shifts.

Bridge Lemma
Construct weight truncations W_{\ge n}^O detected by Φ^L slopes ν_O^eff(L) such that:

    generators lie in weight ≥n,

    orthogonality verified via RO(G)-graded vanishing.

Earliest fail-point
Need negative Ext-vanishing between O-cells and lower cells; again reduces to RO(G)-graded shift compatibility.

Fallback
Prove weight structure only on localized Z/H-strata for minimal Class II groups and glue via recollement.

Status: Unresolved; no_known_theorem extending weight structures to equivariant stable categories with representation-graded shifts.
A3. Effective Dimension Factorization Lemma (Combinatorial Reformulation)

Idea
Re-express ν_O^eff as supremum of slopes of linear inequalities over subgroup lattice; attempt to factor it as:

ν_O^eff(L) = max_{H∈S} |H|/|L∩H| (for suitable S)

If factorization holds, non-uniformity becomes uniform after lattice reweighting.

Bridge Lemma
For Class II systems, there exists lattice reweighting function w(H) such that
dim((ind_K^H(1))^L) = |H|/|L| · w(H,L)
with w bounded uniformly enough to recover inductive slope.

Earliest fail-point
Empirically false in Z/4 case: dim(V^{Z/2}) ≠ |H|/|Z/2| scaled by constant independent of H.

Fallback
Show factorization holds for solvable groups or p-groups; reduce Class II to these minimal obstructions.

Status: Empirically contradicted in smallest case; abandoned.
2) Fastest Theorem-Level Closure Path

Given exhaustive reductions, the only plausible closure path within 48 hours:

Path T (Localized t-Structure Construction for Minimal Case)

Step 1. Restrict to smallest Class II case:
G = Z/4, O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4}.

Step 2. Fully localize category at Z/4-isotropy using isotropy separation (already done).

Step 3. Attempt explicit cell-attachment argument:

    Construct explicit O-slice tower for arbitrary Z/4-local E using only S^{k(1⊕χ)}.

    Compute mapping groups in RO(Z/4) explicitly using character table.

    Show inductive vanishing via direct RO-graded computation (not abstract t-structure).

Kill criterion
If explicit RO(Z/4)-graded mapping computation cannot enforce orthogonality beyond regular case within 12 hours algebraic work → declare irreducible.

Probability of success: low (empirically all prior attempts collapse here).
3) One-Sentence Frontier Statement (if blocked)

    The Class II “if” direction is equivalent to constructing a localized t‑structure (or equivalent weight structure) on the Z/H‑local subcategory generated by non‑regular permutation representation spheres, and this is obstructed by inherently non‑uniform fixed‑point dimension shifts across the subgroup lattice.

Status: Unresolved but sharply isolated.
4) Required External Theorem Statements or no_known_theorem

No existing cited results imply:

    t‑structure for O-cell generators with K≠1.

    RO(G)-graded Whitehead theorem for arbitrary permutation representations.

    Norm adjunction applicable to non‑algebra spectra.

Thus:

    Required external theorem: no_known_theorem (no known published statement yields needed localized t-structure for non-regular O-cells).

48-Hour Ranked Plan with Stop-Loss
Day 1 (8h)

    Explicit RO(Z/4) homotopy computation for V=1⊕χ.

    Compute π_{kV} behavior under isotropy separation.

    Attempt explicit cell-attachment proof for Z/4 minimal case.

Stop-loss: If non-uniform shifts reappear in inductive step → halt.
Day 2 (8h)

    Attempt Euler-class splitting argument.

    Attempt weight-structure construction.

Stop-loss: If both reduce again to non-uniform dim(V^L) obstruction → freeze.
Final Verdict

BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER

    7 theorems proved.

    Class I + Class Ia fully closed.

    Class II reduced to single structural obstruction.

    8+ approach families exhausted (including scout proposals).

    No counterexample found.

    No_known_theorem bridging localized t-structure gap.

P05 remains 🟡 Candidate with a rigorously isolated frontier.

Refining search queries for P05 content

I don’t think I need to use web search here. Instead, it’s important to understand what P05 refers to, as it seems part of a portfolio or math problem. I'll search the files specifically with five queries, one of which will exactly match the user’s request, stripped of extra details for clarity.

Clarifying approach for solving P05

The task involves solving P05, with an emphasis on the "if" direction for Class II. We must discard earlier routes as hard constraints and devise new approach families. After generating at least 12 candidates, we'll analyze these, selecting the top 3. Then, we'll validate the solution and determine if it's "CLOSEABLE_NOW" or "BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER." Key steps include proof skeletons and fallback bridges.
Understanding the theorem and conjectures for effective dimension

The definitions here involve the τ_{≥n}^O subcategory generated by O-cells, and their effective dimension. The theorem states that for any E in τ_{≥n}^O, Φ^L(E) is ceil(n/ν^eff(L))-connective. The conjecture suggests that if geometric fixed points satisfy this connectivity, then E belongs to τ_{≥n}^O. We need more details on the minimal case reduction. Let’s look for “Session 13” or "Gap 1" in the documentation.

Reviewing approach suggestions and P05 details

I have some new approach families based on scout and Kimi suggestions, like Mackey Functor Coherence and Tate square factorization, that may need extension. I'll consider them alongside the experiments bundle file, which might have details relevant for the kill tests. Also, I should focus on closing P05 by proving the "if" direction for class II. The problem implies a known solution, so it might be provable with existing methods.
Breaking down the "if" direction proof

Our task is to find the proof for the "if" direction. Let's carefully analyze what's required. The existing characterization might not be the final answer—perhaps different definitions of slice filtration or effective dimension function should be used, particularly for intermediate transfer systems. The aim is to explore this "if" direction carefully, considering potential alternatives like using O-regular representation. There might be existing theorems from experts to guide us.
Exploring slice filtration and dimension functions for a solution

A possible approach could involve using slice spheres relative to a dimension function. There's existing work on slice filtration, like by Hill-Yarnall, which might extend to more general dimension functions. The gap might stem from using a simplified formula. Could there be a general theorem connecting subgroups, dimension functions, and geometric fixed points? This could lead to a clearer understanding of the "if" direction.
Exploring a general theorem for δ-slice filtration

Hill-Yarnall shows that for regular representation spheres, there’s a t-structure and geometric fixed point connectivity. For general representations, like permutations, maybe a dimension function could define a similar t-structure, yielding δ-slice filtration. This could help close the open case by deriving δ(G/H) from a transfer system. We need to verify if this fits into a broader theorem.
Breaking down the P05 problem and slice filtration approach

The P05 problem asks to define the O-slice filtration and its O-slice connectivity characterization. The answer might be simpler: the O-slice filtration could be the ordinary slice filtration with an effective dimension function derived from O. The proof likely uses Hill-Yarnall's theorem about slice cells and geometric fixed points, but the difficulty lies in the t-structure.
Exploring the 'if' direction and slice filtrations

The idea is that if we can prove that the effective dimension function ν_O² is compatible with certain conditions (exactness, compatibility with restrictions), we could use it to show an ‘if’ direction based on known slice filtration theorem. By generalizing t-structure properties and using geometric fixed points, we might prove the result from first principles.
Considering a spectral sequence approach and verifying characterization

I'm thinking about using the "cellular spectral sequence" to show that connectivity of geometric fixed points means certain maps vanish. It could help demonstrate orthogonality with slice cells. But there might also be a possibility that the 'if' direction doesn't hold for class II, which opens room for exploration.

Defining slice filtration and P05 closure

To wrap up P05, I need to either prove the ‘if’ direction for class II or adjust the definition to make it provable. I could redefine τ_{≥n}^O in a way that simplifies the characterization, but that may feel too much like cheating. Still, I’m allowed to define the slice filtration reasonably.
Finalizing slice filtration definition

They want the slice filtration adapted to O, but I could redefine τ_{≥n}^O to work with O-cells and calibrate it to known filtrations. If I define τ_{≥n}^O as the set of objects whose geometric fixed points meet certain connectivity conditions, the characterization becomes straightforward. I just need to show it's localizing.
Refining the slice filtration definition

It seems plausible to define the slice filtration based on connectivity conditions, which would make the “if” direction easier to prove. However, connecting it to a cell-generated subcategory might not be necessary, depending on how the problem is framed. If the problem only asks for the filtration and characterization, the equivalence may not be required.
Exploring the slice filtration and proof approach

The slice filtration could be defined as a minimal localizing subcategory meeting specific connectivity conditions, but the term "slice filtration" typically implies a cell definition. Candidate A uses O-cells for tau, which aligns with the goal of proving membership via the connectivity of geometric fixed points. To proceed, we should either complete the "if" direction or demonstrate the blocker. Since time isn't a major constraint, we should explore all possible avenues, especially considering advanced tools.
Exploring localizing subcategory and filtration

I'm analyzing the localizing subcategory τ_{≥n}^O, based on induced representation spheres, with ν^eff(L) capturing the ratio of orbits. The key lies in understanding the connectivity of geometric fixed points, which ties into the condition k|H:K|≥n. For the "if" direction, we need to show that a connective G-spectrum E is n-connected. I wonder if using Bousfield localization or cellular approximation could help, but I'm not certain.
Exploring connectivity and localization structures

I'm considering how τ_{≥n}^O is localizing and might relate to Bousfield localization or compact objects in stable categories. If I use truncation functors and cell attachments from spectral sequences, I might establish the connectivity condition. However, handling RO(G)-graded groups could get tricky, though Euler classes may help bypass some issues.
Exploring cofiber sequences and isotropy in permutation representations

I’m considering a possible missing lemma related to cofiber sequences in permutation representations. The idea of a cofiber sequence involving S(V)_+ to S^0 and S^V seems promising. For isotropy, the proper subgroups might allow inductive reasoning similar to the regular representation case, helping in cell decompositions and showing a t-structure.
Considering induction and isotropy in permutation representations

I’m thinking through an approach where we use induction in equivariant stable homotopy to simplify the analysis of isotropy groups for permutation representations. Decomposing them and applying the decomposition via induced representations might help control the connectivity of geometric fixed points, especially using cofiber sequences.
Exploring isotropy in permutation representations

For permutation representations, I’m considering how the sphere S(V) might have a CW structure with isotropy groups corresponding to stabilizers of vectors. These stabilizers could be subconjugate to K, which suggests that the isotropy groups are contained within conjugates of K, enabling possible induction.
Exploring isotropy, suspension, and connectivity for representations

When considering the one-point compactification of S(V), the isotropy group at the "infinity" point is H, while the sphere S(V) shows isotropy in subgroups based on K. I think this idea can help with proving vanishing of homotopy groups under certain connectivity conditions, potentially offering a t-structure.
Exploring slice filtration and connectivity conditions

To ensure the minimal connectivity condition for Φ^L(E), we want to prove using isotropy separation and induction. For more general representations, defining a partial order based on "fixed point dimension" might be necessary. I might need to refer to Hill-Yarnall's work, which could provide a framework for generalized slice filtrations.
Exploring candidate approach families and minimal open case

We need to ensure that our new candidate approach families are genuinely novel, avoiding reworking previous attempts or well-known theorems. The focus on Z/4-local spectra and localizing modules generated by S^{kV} offers a promising path. We'll work on proving connectivity conditions and exploring the effective dimension function for the minimal open case.

Exploring G-local spectra equivalence

I’m thinking through the equivalence of G-local spectra and spectra with G-action. Geometric fixed points and localization seem to play a role in this. I wonder if, when isotropy is only the group G, the spectrum ends up being contractible or not. I need to clarify the nature of ẼP_G's underlying structure.
Reflecting on G-local spectra and localization

I’m thinking that ẼP_G is contractible, but when smashed with it, it could affect the underlying structure. However, the fixed points in G-spectra remain distinct. I’m wondering if G-local spectra with geometric fixed points might equate to spectra with Weyl group action—though I’m unsure about isotropy in this case.
Exploring G-local objects with geometric fixed points

I’m thinking that to get G-local spectra, I might need to use coinduction, though it's unclear. However, smashing with ẼP_G and considering geometric fixed points could provide an equivalence between categories—showing that this approach works with the right setup.
Exploring equivalences in G-local category

I’m considering whether Sp^G_{<G>} (or G-local category) might simplify the minimal-case computation.
Exploring fixed points and connectivity in G-local spectra

I’m considering the relationship between G-local objects and fixed points. If we focus on the G-fixed points, structures tied to proper subgroups might vanish. Smashing with other spheres, I wonder if geometric fixed points could show how connectivity shifts by a specific dimension—essentially linking connectivity to shifts in integer values.

Considering new approaches to defining τ≥n^O and connecting to generators

I’m reconsidering how to approach this proof—perhaps using Bousfield localization and recollement to avoid the t-structure. We could modify the τ≥n^O definition to involve effective dimension functions, aligning it with uniform dimension criteria. However, we need to choose an appropriate generator set while ensuring we match the original t-structure.
Exploring regular representations and G-spectra universes for slice filtration

I’m considering the use of the regular representation ρ_H^O for the N∞ operad’s slice filtration. Perhaps a G-universe could be helpful here, where stable homotopy categories like Sp^G_U might offer a different approach to geometric fixed points. This could affect the filtrations and regularity of the approach.
Exploring slice filtration and the frontier certificate

I’m pondering the "incomplete universe" stable homotopy and slice filtration, possibly explored by Hill and collaborators.
Considering representation localization and isotropy separation

I’m exploring how localization at a subgroup H might reduce the representation sphere to S^1, with only H-fixed points remaining. If this happens, the t-structure could align with ordinary Postnikov for minimal cases. The gluing process for isotropy across subgroups might lead to a plausible construction.

The user authorizes the use of "off-limits" or potentially contaminating sources as a last-resort measure to solve the problem, prioritizing eventual resolution over strict source limitations. They require documentation of the contamination level and the reasoning behind expanding the search scope.
Evaluating approach to solving with external sources

The user may expect us to search for solutions, but we need to exercise caution. Web access is available, but we should use it only when necessary. The task seems to involve locating foundational proofs or literature related to "O-slice filtration," though the user has noted they aren't available.
Approaching the "if" direction for Class II transfer systems

We need to prove the "if" direction for Class II transfer systems: if Φ^L(E) is ceil(n/ν_O^{eff}(L))-connective for all L ≤ G, then E ∈ τ_{≥n}^O. Previous approaches faced challenges due to non-uniform fixed-point dimensions when K ≠ 1. Time to explore potential new strategies for this proof.
Exploring ideas for proving the "if" direction abstractly

I’m wondering if there might be a known theorem that could help prove the "if" direction here. Maybe we could use Bousfield localization or cellularization techniques to study closure properties. We'll focus on showing the minimal localizing subcategory and reverse inclusion to prove the necessary result.
Characterizing localizing subcategories for fixed point connectivities

To prove the claim, we need to show that if E satisfies fixed-point connectivities, it lies in the localizing subcategory generated by O-cells. This feels similar to characterization techniques using vanishing maps from compact objects or Bousfield localization. I’ll explore how these concepts apply in this context.
Refining approach to localizing subcategories and induction

I’m considering using cellular spectral sequences or geometric fixed point functors Φ^L to build E from cells. The structure of localizing subcategories might allow characterization using dimension functions. Induction based on subgroup height may still fail due to cross-level mixing.
Refining τ_{≥n}^O definition and proof strategy

I’m wondering if we’ve misunderstood the definition of τ_{≥n}^O. The question asks to define slice filtration adapted to O; maybe redefining using geometric fixed-point connectivities closes the characterization, though this may be definitional rather than constructive.
Clarifying localizing subcategories and their stability

I’m trying to reconcile τ_{≥n}^O with t-structures. If generators are stable under desuspension, this resembles localizing/Bousfield behavior more than a strict t-structure. Need to confirm assumptions about k ranges in slice-cell definitions.
Exploring τ_{≥n} and Bousfield localization's role

The definition may be better treated as stable localizing filtration rather than a classical t-structure; perhaps adapt Hill-Yarnall-style arguments with geometric fixed points and dimension functions.
Exploring O-slice filtration and dimension functions

Dimension-function framing seems central. The unresolved part is proving reverse inclusion for non-regular generators.
Adapting slice filtration and dimension functions

Potential strategy: prove τ_{≥n}^O equals a ν-slice filtration detected by Φ^L connectivity. This would close “if” if equivalence can be shown.
