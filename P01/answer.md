# Answer: P01

**Status**: ❌ Parked
**Reviewer**: Codex supervisor audit — park confirmed (blocked on references)
**External deps**: Unresolved (`Hairer 2014`, `Barashkov-Gubinelli 2020`, `Albeverio-Kusuoka 2021`)

## Problem statement

Question: quasi-invariance of the $\Phi^4_3$ measure under smooth translation.

## Outcome

No proof or disproof was completed in this sprint lane.

The lane was parked at G2 due to blocked primary dependencies needed for the core integrability step (exponential moments involving Wick powers).

## What is established

- G0 formalization completed.
- G1 dependency map completed.
- G2 route map completed.

## What is unresolved

- Statement-level closure of key external results needed for Route A.
- Any proof-level closure of quasi-invariance or singularity.
