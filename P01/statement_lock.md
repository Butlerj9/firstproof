# Statement Lock (Retrospective)

- Problem: `P01`
- Date locked: 2026-02-14
- Locked by: Codex (retrospective control pass)

## Canonical statement

Let `mu` be the `Phi^4_3` measure on `D'(T^3)`. For nonzero smooth `psi`, are `mu` and `(T_psi)_* mu` equivalent (same null sets)?

## Quantifier normal form

`for all smooth psi != 0, are the two measures equivalent?`

## Decision polarity lock

- Positive claim requires a full quasi-invariance proof at statement level.
- Negative claim requires a singularity proof at statement level.

## Forbidden drift

1. Substituting equivalence with free-field measure for shift quasi-invariance of `Phi^4_3`.
2. Promoting a rough sketch citation to full closure without contradiction check.

## Contradiction trigger

If a primary source explicitly states mutual singularity (or equivalence), lane closure must reconcile that exact statement before `Submitted`.
