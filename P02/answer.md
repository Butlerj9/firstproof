# Answer: P02

**Status**: ❌ Parked
**Reviewer**: Codex supervisor audit — park confirmed (blocked on specialized references)
**External deps**: Unresolved (`JPSS` conductor theory, `Matringe` essential Whittaker functions)

## Problem statement

Question: nonvanishing/entirety property for a modified local Rankin-Selberg integral in Whittaker models.

## Outcome

No theorem-level resolution was completed in this sprint lane.

The lane was parked at G2 after feasibility analysis because critical primary sources for the $u_Q$-modified integral mechanism were unavailable in scope.

## What is established

- G0 formalization completed.
- G1 background/dependency triage completed.
- G2 route map completed.

## What is unresolved

- Precise theorem-level behavior of the $u_Q$ perturbation in the stated quantifier regime.
- Any complete YES/NO proof under statement-number citations.
