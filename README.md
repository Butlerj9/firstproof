# First Proof — Agentic LLM Orchestration for Research-Grade Mathematics

**Sprint**: Feb 10-13, 2026 | **Answers release**: Feb 13 11:59 PM PT
**Agents**: Claude Opus 4.6 (Implementer) + Codex 5.2 (Reviewer) + multi-model scouts
**Human role**: Logistics only (no mathematical ideas or content)
**Paper**: [arXiv:2602.05192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05192) | [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org)

## Autonomy statement

This run follows the [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org) autonomy standard:
no human mathematical ideas/content and no human isolation of the mathematical
core. All mathematical artifacts were agent-authored.

Producer activity was runtime-operator only: prompt dispatch/handoffs, rule-bound
administrative decisions under pre-decided gates/escalation policy, and verbatim
execution of agent-authored procedures. No expert-level mathematical judgment
was used for domain interpretation, solution procedures, or solution content.
The operator remained abstracted from problem/solution steps and evaluated only
structural response quality (gate compliance, artifact completeness, status
classification consistency), while mathematical correctness was delegated to
agent review and executable checks.
Full protocol and constraints are in `methods_extended.md`. Enforcement and
provenance are logged in `PXX/audit.md`, `PXX/transcript.md`, and
`CONTAMINATION.md`.

## How to read this repo

- `docs/README.md` — documentation index (methods/results/reference layout)
- `PXX/answer.md` — the actual answer (start here)
- `PXX/audit.md` — what worked, what failed, routes tried, human intervention log
- `PXX/experiments/` — verification scripts and outputs
- `PXX/transcript.md` — interaction log (full where available; some parked lanes contain summary stubs)
- `CONTAMINATION.md` — search log and exposure declarations
- `RESULTS.md` — consolidated progress, escalations, final outcomes, and token/message accounting
- `methods_extended.md` — experimental setup, autonomy boundary, and enforcement protocol

## Extended Model Tooling

Shared scout tooling is in `tools/`:

- `tools/scout_api.py` — unified OpenAI-compatible caller for `groq`, `moonshot`, `fireworks`, and custom providers.
- `tools/model_capability_probe.py` — repeatable cross-model benchmark harness for quick model triage before using a scout in a proof loop.
- `tools/README.md` — commands, provider setup, and probe usage.

Recommended use:

- Use scouts sparingly when blocked on a narrow microdomain or a core-lemma sanity check.
- Prefer local derivation and in-repo experiments first.
- Avoid web-searching foundational lemmas for llm-only runs; keep contamination policy in `CONTAMINATION.md`.
