# First Proof — Multi-Agent AI Attempt

**Sprint**: Feb 10-13, 2026 | **Answers release**: Feb 13 11:59 PM PT
**Agents**: Claude Opus 4.6 (Implementer) + Codex 5.2 (Reviewer) + multi-model scouts
**Human role**: Logistics only (no mathematical ideas or content)
**Paper**: [arXiv:2602.05192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05192) | [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org)

## Autonomy statement

This run follows the [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org) autonomy standard:
no human mathematical ideas/content and no human isolation of the mathematical
core. All mathematical artifacts were agent-authored.

Producer activity was limited to prompt dispatch/handoffs, occasional
administrative decisions, and verbatim execution of agent-authored procedures.
Full protocol and constraints are in `methods_extended.md`. Enforcement and
provenance are logged in `PXX/audit.md`, `PXX/transcript.md`, and
`CONTAMINATION.md`.

## How to read this repo

- `docs/README.md` — documentation index (methods/results/reference layout)
- `PXX/answer.md` — the actual answer (start here)
- `PXX/audit.md` — what worked, what failed, routes tried, human intervention log
- `PXX/experiments/` — verification scripts and outputs
- `PXX/transcript.md` — interaction log (full where available; some parked lanes contain summary stubs)
- `CONTAMINATION.md` — search log and exposure declarations
- `RESULTS.md` — consolidated progress, escalations, final outcomes, and token/message accounting
- `methods_extended.md` — experimental setup, autonomy boundary, and enforcement protocol

## Extended Model Tooling

Shared scout tooling is in `tools/`:

- `tools/scout_api.py` — unified OpenAI-compatible caller for `groq`, `moonshot`, `fireworks`, and custom providers.
- `tools/model_capability_probe.py` — repeatable cross-model benchmark harness for quick model triage before using a scout in a proof loop.
- `tools/README.md` — commands, provider setup, and probe usage.

Recommended use:

- Use scouts sparingly when blocked on a narrow microdomain or a core-lemma sanity check.
- Prefer local derivation and in-repo experiments first.
- Avoid web-searching foundational lemmas for llm-only runs; keep contamination policy in `CONTAMINATION.md`.
