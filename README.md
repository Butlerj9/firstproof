# First Proof — Multi-Agent AI Attempt

**Sprint**: Feb 10-13, 2026 | **Answers release**: Feb 13 11:59 PM PT
**Agents**: Claude Opus 4.6 (Implementer) + Codex 5.2 (Reviewer) + multi-model scouts
**Human role**: Logistics only (no mathematical ideas or content)
**Paper**: [arXiv:2602.05192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05192) | [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org)

## Autonomy statement

Per [1stproof.org](https://1stproof.org): "We consider that an AI model has
answered one of our questions if it can produce in an *autonomous* way a proof
that conforms to the levels of rigor and scholarship prevailing in the
mathematics literature. In particular, the AI should not rely on human input
for any mathematical idea or content, or to help it isolate the core of the
problem."

All mathematical content in this repository was generated by AI agents.
The human producer provided: repository setup, reference PDF sourcing
(without interpretation), Python/CAS environment setup, scheduling decisions,
and logging compliance checks. Every human intervention is logged in each
problem's `audit.md` with classification (ADMIN/LOGISTICS).

## How to read this repo

- `PXX/answer.md` — the actual answer (start here)
- `PXX/audit.md` — what worked, what failed, routes tried, human intervention log
- `PXX/experiments/` — verification scripts and outputs
- `PXX/transcript.md` — complete AI interaction log
- `CONTAMINATION.md` — search log and exposure declarations

## Extended Model Tooling

Shared scout tooling is in `tools/`:

- `tools/scout_api.py` — unified OpenAI-compatible caller for `groq`, `moonshot`, `fireworks`, and custom providers.
- `tools/model_capability_probe.py` — repeatable cross-model benchmark harness for quick model triage before using a scout in a proof loop.
- `tools/README.md` — commands, provider setup, and probe usage.

Recommended use:

- Use scouts sparingly when blocked on a narrow microdomain or a core-lemma sanity check.
- Prefer local derivation and in-repo experiments first.
- Avoid web-searching foundational lemmas for llm-only runs; keep contamination policy in `CONTAMINATION.md`.
