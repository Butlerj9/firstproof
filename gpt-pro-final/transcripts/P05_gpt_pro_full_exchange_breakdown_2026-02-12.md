# GPT-pro Exchange Breakdown — P05

Date: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided full exchange transcript  
Lane: P05  
Purpose: Structured extraction for integration into P05 audit/transcript workflow.

## 1) Breakdown by Phase

### Phase A: Problem framing
- Lane-only scope enforced (`P05` only).
- Objective enforced: theorem-level closure or rigorous frontier certificate.
- Prior failed-route set treated as hard constraints.

### Phase B: Escalation policy update
- User explicitly allowed last-resort potentially contaminating sources.
- Documentation requirement preserved:
  - contamination level,
  - escalation rationale,
  - source logging.

### Phase C: Model verdict
- Output verdict: `BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER`.
- Best bridge target: localized t-structure for non-regular cells.
- Minimal kill-test case: `G=Z/4`, `O={Z/2 <=_O Z/4}`.

### Phase D: Proposed approach families
- A1 Euler-class detection route.
- A2 Weight-structure replacement route.
- A3 Effective-dimension factorization route.

### Phase E: Process trace signals
- Local packet inspection + failed-route mining.
- Attempts to find external framing theorems.
- Convergence back to same obstruction class.

## 2) Extracted Claims by Evidence Tier

### Proved (already in-lane context)
- No new theorem-level closure from this GPT-pro round.
- Existing 7-theorem P05 scope unchanged.

### Cited
- No concrete new statement-level theorem was supplied.
- Output explicitly returns `no_known_theorem` for required missing bridge.

### Empirical / exploratory
- Route-level plausibility ranking.
- Minimal-case tactical plan (RO(Z/4)-graded mapping computations).

### Unresolved
- Class II “if” direction remains open.
- Core blocker remains non-uniform fixed-point dimensions for non-regular permutation representations.

---

## 3) Novelty Assessment vs Existing P05 Routes

### A1 Euler-class route
- Potentially adjacent to prior geometric-fixed-point machinery, but not a strict duplicate.
- Worth one bounded kill-test in minimal case.

### A2 Weight-structure route
- Structurally different from explicit t-structure route.
- Still likely to collapse to RO(G)-graded orthogonality constraints.

### A3 Factorization route
- Lowest priority.
- Transcript itself marks likely contradiction in minimal case.

## 4) Contamination / Escalation Interpretation

- User authorized last-resort contamination-tolerant escalation.
- Model trace indicates attempts to consult broader literature context.
- No direct claim of importing a solved proof for P05.
- Recommended classification for this GPT-pro round:
  - Escalation level: high (research-mode expansion attempted),
  - Contamination risk: medium (broader theorem search),
  - Incorporation decision: partial (strategic ideas only, no direct proof import).

---

## 5) Integration Guidance (for core repo artifacts)

### Suggested additions to `P05/transcript.md`
- Add a compact “External model round (GPT-pro)” block with:
  - lane-only prompt,
  - contamination override instruction,
  - verdict (`BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER`),
  - top 3 proposed routes,
  - minimal-case kill-test recommendation.

### Suggested additions to `P05/audit.md`
- Add one escalation row:
  - trigger: final frontier check,
  - action: GPT-pro lane-only synthesis,
  - result: no closure, frontier sharpened,
  - decision: hold at candidate.

### Suggested additions to `CONTAMINATION.md`
- If treated as external-source exposure, log this as model-assisted escalation event:
  - source class: external LLM synthesis,
  - risk: medium,
  - action: strategic guidance only (no direct proof copy).

## 6) Recommended One-More-Round Gate (P05 only)

Run one bounded round only if all conditions hold:
- focus strictly on minimal case `Z/4`;
- enforce stop-loss;
- test only A1/A2;
- terminate on recurrence of same obstruction.

If recurrence confirmed again: freeze P05 as `🟡 Candidate` with frontier statement unchanged.
