# GPT-pro Full Exchange — P03 (Round 2)

Date captured: 2026-02-13  
Source: User-provided response (manual paste)  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Preserve complete intake context for audit traceability and downstream execution planning.

---

## 1) Intake identity

The response is a full P03 scout artifact with:

1. `SECTION A` lane verdict table,
2. `SECTION B` failure map + approach families + top-3 + frontier statement + 48h plan,
3. explicit "Claude Code handoff" script suggestions.

---

## 2) Core mathematical positioning

1. Lane remains `BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER`.
2. Proposed minimal blocker is reframed as a divisibility/eigenvalue transfer statement:
   - `(T_i - t)E*_{lambda^-}` should be divisible by `(1-q)`,
   - implying the q->1 limit satisfies Hecke eigen-relations forcing symmetry.
3. Top route stack in this intake:
   - LRW/Sahi expansion collapse at q=1 + AS structure,
   - direct divisibility lemma route,
   - BDW signed multiline queue factorization route.

---

## 3) Distinctive additions vs prior P03 scout artifacts

1. Strong emphasis on `(1-q)` divisibility as the minimal bridge lemma.
2. Concrete near-term kill-tests for divisibility and queue-factorization paths.
3. Explicitly links "fastest closure path" to proving divisibility, rather than broad route exploration.

---

## 4) Integration decision

1. Archive as round-2 GPT-pro scout input.
2. Do not treat as theorem-level advancement.
3. Use this artifact jointly with recent Claude-research P03 rounds for a combined review checklist and route selection.
