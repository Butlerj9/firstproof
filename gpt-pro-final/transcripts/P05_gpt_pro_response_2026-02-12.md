SECTION B: Actionable Plan

## 1) Top 3 Novel Approaches (non-variants of prior 5+ attempts)

Below are filtered for **non-variant** status relative to: (i) global t-structure attempt, (ii) orbit/Postnikov induction, (iii) geometric FP detection, (iv) norm/restriction adjunction, (v) isotropy separation reduction, plus scout proposals already reduced to same obstruction.

---

### A1. **Bredon–Euler Class Detection Lemma (Obstruction-Splitting Approach)**

**Idea**
Exploit that for Class II systems, the problematic generators are permutation reps V = ind_K^H(1) with K≠1. These have nontrivial Euler class e(V) in RO(G)-graded Bredon cohomology. Hypothesis: multiplication by e(V) detects precisely the O-slice obstruction.

**Target Bridge Lemma**
If Φ^L(E) satisfies the ν_O^eff connectivity bounds, then e(V)^k annihilates the relevant RO(G)-graded homotopy Mackey functors below degree n, forcing E into τ_{≥n}^O.

**Earliest fail-point**
Need functorial control of Euler class action on geometric fixed points across all L simultaneously. Non-uniformity of dim(V^L) reappears as different vanishing slopes.

**Fallback micro-lemma**
Show that for minimal Class II case (Z/4), multiplication by e(1⊕χ) splits isotropy separation fiber, reducing to regular case after inverting e(χ).

**Status**: Unresolved; no_known_theorem guaranteeing such uniform Euler control.

---

### A2. **Weight-Structure (Not t-Structure) Replacement**

**Idea**
Instead of forcing τ_{≥n}^O to be a t-structure (blocked), attempt a **weight structure** (Bondarko-style) on Sp^G localized at O. Weight structures require different orthogonality axioms and may tolerate non-uniform shifts.

**Bridge Lemma**
Construct weight truncations W_{\ge n}^O detected by Φ^L slopes ν_O^eff(L) such that:

* generators lie in weight ≥n,
* orthogonality verified via RO(G)-graded vanishing.

**Earliest fail-point**
Need negative Ext-vanishing between O-cells and lower cells; again reduces to RO(G)-graded shift compatibility.

**Fallback**
Prove weight structure only on localized Z/H-strata for minimal Class II groups and glue via recollement.

**Status**: Unresolved; no_known_theorem extending weight structures to equivariant stable categories with representation-graded shifts.

---

### A3. **Effective Dimension Factorization Lemma (Combinatorial Reformulation)**

**Idea**
Re-express ν_O^eff as supremum of slopes of linear inequalities over subgroup lattice; attempt to factor it as:

ν_O^eff(L) = max_{H∈S} |H|/|L∩H|  (for suitable S)

If factorization holds, non-uniformity becomes uniform after lattice reweighting.

**Bridge Lemma**
For Class II systems, there exists lattice reweighting function w(H) such that
dim((ind_K^H(1))^L) = |H|/|L| · w(H,L)
with w bounded uniformly enough to recover inductive slope.

**Earliest fail-point**
Empirically false in Z/4 case: dim(V^{Z/2}) ≠ |H|/|Z/2| scaled by constant independent of H.

**Fallback**
Show factorization holds for solvable groups or p-groups; reduce Class II to these minimal obstructions.

**Status**: Empirically contradicted in smallest case; abandoned.

---

## 2) Fastest Theorem-Level Closure Path

Given exhaustive reductions, the only plausible closure path within 48 hours:

**Path T (Localized t-Structure Construction for Minimal Case)**

Step 1. Restrict to smallest Class II case:
G = Z/4, O = {Z/2 ≤_O Z/4}.

Step 2. Fully localize category at Z/4-isotropy using isotropy separation (already done).

Step 3. Attempt explicit cell-attachment argument:

* Construct explicit O-slice tower for arbitrary Z/4-local E using only S^{k(1⊕χ)}.
* Compute mapping groups in RO(Z/4) explicitly using character table.
* Show inductive vanishing via direct RO-graded computation (not abstract t-structure).

**Kill criterion**
If explicit RO(Z/4)-graded mapping computation cannot enforce orthogonality beyond regular case within 12 hours algebraic work → declare irreducible.

Probability of success: low (empirically all prior attempts collapse here).

---

## 3) One-Sentence Frontier Statement (if blocked)

> The Class II “if” direction is equivalent to constructing a localized t‑structure (or equivalent weight structure) on the Z/H‑local subcategory generated by non‑regular permutation representation spheres, and this is obstructed by inherently non‑uniform fixed‑point dimension shifts across the subgroup lattice.

Status: **Unresolved but sharply isolated**.

---

## 4) Required External Theorem Statements or no_known_theorem

No existing cited results imply:

* t‑structure for O-cell generators with K≠1.
* RO(G)-graded Whitehead theorem for arbitrary permutation representations.
* Norm adjunction applicable to non‑algebra spectra.

Thus:

* Required external theorem: **no_known_theorem** (no known published statement yields needed localized t-structure for non-regular O-cells).

---

## 48-Hour Ranked Plan with Stop-Loss

### Day 1 (8h)

1. Explicit RO(Z/4) homotopy computation for V=1⊕χ.
2. Compute π_{kV} behavior under isotropy separation.
3. Attempt explicit cell-attachment proof for Z/4 minimal case.

**Stop-loss**: If non-uniform shifts reappear in inductive step → halt.

### Day 2 (8h)

4. Attempt Euler-class splitting argument.
5. Attempt weight-structure construction.

**Stop-loss**: If both reduce again to non-uniform dim(V^L) obstruction → freeze.

---

# Final Verdict

**BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER**

* 7 theorems proved.
* Class I + Class Ia fully closed.
* Class II reduced to single structural obstruction.
* 8+ approach families exhausted (including scout proposals).
* No counterexample found.
* No_known_theorem bridging localized t-structure gap.

P05 remains 🟡 Candidate with a rigorously isolated frontier.
