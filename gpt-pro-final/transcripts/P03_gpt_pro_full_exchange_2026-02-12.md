# GPT-pro Full Exchange Transcript — P03

Date captured: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided GPT-pro response + process trace (manual paste)  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Preserve the full escalation output including reasoning process trace for audit and integration.

## 1) Main mathematical response

Primary response is archived verbatim at:
- `gpt-pro-final/transcripts/P03_gpt_pro_response_2026-02-12.md`

Key outcome:
- Verdict: `BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER`.
- Critical correction: under standard interpolation definitions, the prior x-independent Mallows reduction is not valid (already fails at n=2).
- New target: explicit polynomial-free local generator for x-dependent stationary weights.

## 2) Process trace (as provided by user)

The supplied trace includes:
1. repeated local-file ingestion attempts (`file_search` fallback to `/mnt/data` direct reads),
2. extraction from problem context and experiment bundles (`EXP-20` barrier focus),
3. exploratory theorem search on interpolation Macdonald / q=1 / t-PushTASEP literature,
4. route synthesis, kill-test design, and final frontier verdict.

Representative lines from the supplied process trace:

## 3) Contamination/escalation interpretation

This exchange includes web-research expansion and should be treated as research-escalated:
- references include recent and post-cutoff items,
- one route depends on a future/proposed interpolation probabilistic analogue.

Before incorporating claims into core lane artifacts:
1. verify each theorem statement from primary sources,
2. log contamination metadata (`source`, `UTC`, `exact extracted statement`, `risk`, `use/quarantine`),
3. keep lane status unchanged until a checkable bridge lemma is implemented.

---

## 4) Integration guidance

1. Add a P03 escalation entry in `P03/audit.md` summarizing:
   - Mallows-route invalidation under standard definitions,
   - new frontier (local exchange relations -> generator).
2. Add a compact transcript row in `P03/transcript.md` with artifact paths.
3. Do not upgrade P03 status without theorem-level closure.
