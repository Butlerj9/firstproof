1.Indexed slice categories
(Excerpt from “Generalized equivariant slice categories”, with Mike Hill and
Tyler Lawson.)
1.1.Transfer and indexing systems.We begin with an ahistorical but geodesic
summary of transfer systems and indexing systems.
Definition 1.1( [1], [5]).Atransfer systemonGis a partial order we will denote
by→on Sub(G) satisfying three properties:
(1) it refines subgroup inclusion: ifH→K, thenH⊆K,
(2) it is conjugation invariant: ifH→Kandg∈G, thengHg −1 →gKg −1,
and
(3) it is closed under restriction: ifH→KandJ⊆K, thenH∩J→J.
The collection of all transfer systems onGforms a poset under refinement, and
we will use≤for the partial order here.
Definition 1.2.LetObe a transfer system onG. A finiteH-set
T=
a
i
H/Ki
isadmissibleforOif for alli,K i →H. The collection of admissibleH-sets forO
will be denotedO(H). The collection of allO(H) asHvaries gives anindexing
system.
The admissible sets ofOare closely connected to the norms structured by anN ∞
operad; we will usually also abusively denote the operad byO. Herei H
∗ :Sp G →
Sp H denotes the pullback functor along the inclusionH→GandN G
H :Sp H → Sp G
denotes the Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm [3].
Definition 1.3.For a finiteG-setT, we define theT-norm
N T :Sp G → Sp G
inductively by the formulas
(1)N G/H(E) =N G
H i∗
H(E), and
(2)N T0⨿T1(E) =N T0(E)⊗N T1(E).
1.2.O-slice filtration.We now define the slice filtration relative to an indexing
systemO. We are going to use equivariant localization (more specifically, nullifica-
tion) to construct the relative slice towers. Recall that in the equivariant context,
we define local and acylic objects in terms of conditions on theG-space of maps
rather than the non-equivariant space of maps. The acylic objects form an equi-
variant localizing subcategory. Recall that given a set of objects inSp G, we define
the equivariant localizing subcategory generated by these objects to be the full sub-
category ofSp G constructed as the closure under homotopy colimits, retracts, and
tensors with orbit spectra.
Definition 1.4.IfOis an indexing system, then letτ O
≥n be the equivariant local-
izing subcategory ofSp G generated byn
G+ ⊗
H
N T S1 |T∈ O(H),|T| ≥n
o
.
This is the category ofO-slicen-connective spectra.

Remark1.5.Given a finiteG-setT, we have an equivariant homeomorphism
N T S1 ∼= SR·T ,
the representation sphere associated to the permutation representation ofT. This
means that theO-slicen-connective spectra can be equivalently viewed as being
generated by the representation spheres associated to the permutation representa-
tions for admissible sets of cardinality at leastn.
Viewing this instead as a diagram of localizing subcategories (i.e., as a categorical
Mackey functor), we are forming the equivariant localizing subcategory generated
atG/HbyN T S1 for all admissibleH-setsTof cardinality at leastn.
For the next definition, recall that the nullification at a set of objects{S i}in
Sp G is the left Bousfield localization at the set of terminal maps{S i → ∗}.
Definition 1.6.IfOis an indexing system, then:
•ThenthO-slice truncation is the functor
P n
O :Sp G
≥0 → Sp G
≥0
that is the nullification killingτ O
≥(n+1).
•ThenthO-slice cover is the functor
P O
n :Sp G
≥0 → Sp G
≥0
defined to be the (homotopy) fiber of the natural mapId⇒P n−1
O .
The truncation functors are related in the evident fashion asnvaries.
Proposition 1.7.For eachn≥0, we have a natural transformation
P n
O(-)⇒P n−1
O (-).
These are compatible with the natural nullification functors
Id⇒P n
O(-).
For a connectiveG-spectrumE, the natural map
E→lim
← −
P n
O(E)
is always a weak equivalence.
Proof.The inclusion of categoriesτ O
n+2 ⊂τ O
n+1 induces a natural transformation
the other way of nullification functors. Since we can factor the nullification functor
P n
O via this inclusion, the first two statements follow.
For the second, we note that the Postnikov connectivity ofG + ⊗
H
N T S1 for a
finiteH-setTis|T /H|. Asngoes to infinity, this also does (at worst as|T|/|H|).
In particular, the map
E→P n
O(E)
has coconnectivity going to infinity.□
For any bounded below spectrumK, the same argument shows that the natural
map
K⊗E→lim
← −

K⊗P nE

is an equivalence.

(1) it is inτ O
≥n, and
(2) the natural map
E→P n
OE
is an equivalence.
Proposition 1.9.For any indexing systemO, the ordinary suspension yields maps
Σ:τ O
≥k →τ O
≥(k+1).
Proof.Since suspension commutes with homotopy colimits and induction, it suffices
to show this on the generatorsN T S1 asTvaries over the admissible sets ofO. Since
ΣN T S1 ≃N T⨿∗ S1, the result follows: ifTis admissible and of cardinality at least
kthenT⨿ ∗is admissible and has cardinality at leastk+ 1.□
Corollary 1.10.For anyk≥0, the∞-category ofO-k-slices is discrete.
Proof.IfE, E ′ areO-k-slices, then they are both inτ O
≥k. By the usual adjunctions,
for alln≥1, the higher homotopy groupπ n of the mapping space are given by
πn Map(E, E ′) = [ΣnE, E ′]G = 0,
since the preceding proposition implies that Σ nE∈τ O
≥(k+n).□
Definition 1.11.We definen th O-sliceof a connectiveG-spectrumE, denoted
P n
n,O(E), to be the homotopy fiber of the natural map
P n
O(E)→P n−1
O (E).
2.Characterizing slice towers via connectivity
2.1.Geometric fixed points and slice connectivity.We can detect slice con-
nectivity in terms of the connectivity of the geometric fixed points [4,6]. To express
this, it is convenient to define the following function capturing the structure of the
indexing system.
Definition 2.1.For any transfer systemO, we define thecharacteristic function
ofO
χO : Sub(G)→Sub(G)
by the formula
χO(H) = min{K|K→H}=
\
K→H
K.
2.1.1.The geometric fixed points ofτ O
≥n.Stable equivalences inSp G can be de-
tected as maps that induce non-equivariant stable equivalences on passage to geo-
metric fixed points for all (closed) subgroups ofG. It should thus be very plausible
that the connectivity of geometric fixed points is a central notion.
Definition 2.2.For aG-spectrumE, let thegeometric connectivity, denoted
gconn(E), be the function from subgroups ofGtoZ∪ {±∞}defined by
gconn(E)(H) := conn

ϕH(E)

.
Lemma 2.3.LetObe a transfer system. IfE∈τ O
≥n, then for allH⊂G,
[H:χ O(H)]·gconn (E)(H)≥n.

Proof.By restriction, it suffices to show this forH=G. Since the geometric
fixed points preserve homotopy colimits and extensions, it suffices to show this for
generators. Next, since geometric fixed points applied to an inducedG-spectrum
vanish, we are reduced to considering the case ofN T S1 forTan admissibleG-set
of cardinality at leastn. DecomposeTas
T=
X
H
nH G/H.
The geometric fixed points ofN T S1 areS |T /G|, and in this case, we have
|T /G|=
X
H
nH .
We have by assumption
|T|=
X
H
nH[G:H]≥n,
and by definition, [G:χ O(H)] is the maximal element in

[G:H]|G/H∈ O(∗)
	
(and in fact, all others divide it). This gives inequalities
[G:χ O(G)]·
X
H
nH ≥
X
H
nH[G:H]≥n,
as desired.□
Remark2.4.Ifχ O(G) ={e}, then we recover [4, Theorem 2.5].
For the converse, we can again use isotropy separation, studying the cofiber
sequence
EF+ ⊗E→E→ ˜EF ⊗E.
The spectrumEF + ⊗Eis built out of pieces of the formG/H + ⊗E, so this is in
a localizing subcategory if and only if the restrictions are.
Lemma 2.5.LetFbe a family, and letτbe an equivariant localizing subcategory.
IfEis anyG-spectrum such that for allH∈ F,i ∗
H E∈i ∗
H τ, then
(EF+ ⊗E)∈τ
Proof.This follows by the same proof as [4, Lemma 2.4]: the spectrumEF + ⊗E
is in the localizing category generated byG/H + ⊗EforH∈ F. By assumption,
we have an inclusion
G/H+ ⊗E ∼= G+ ⊗
H
i∗
H E∈τ.
□
TheO-slices of geometric spectra.Our argument will use downward induction on
the subgroup lattice, so we will need to understand theO-slice connectivity of
˜EP ⊗E, wherePis the family of proper subgroups ofG. Recall that aG-spectrum
Eis called “geometric” if the natural map
E→ ˜EP ⊗E
is an equivalence [2, Definition 6.10], and a Mackey functorM is geometric ifHM
is. The proof of [2, Theorem 6.7] goes through essentially without change to show
the following.

Lemma 2.6.LetM be a geometric Mackey functor. For anyO,
ΣkHM
is ak·[G:χ OG]-O-slice.
Proof.SinceM is geometric, we have that for any finiteG-setT, the natural map
S|T /G| ,→N T S1
given by the inclusion of fixed points induces an equivalence
S|T /G| ⊗HM →N T S1 ⊗HM .
We can bound theO-slice connectivity from below by choosing anO-admissibleT
with|T|as large as possible so that|T /G|=kis fixed. This is again achieved by
taking
T=kG/χ O(G),
sinceχ O(G) is the minimal subgroupHsuch thatH→G. This shows us that
ΣkHM ∈τ O
≥k[G:χO(G)].
For the upper bound, consider an admissibleG-setTsuch that
|T|> k[G:χ O(G)].
Sincek[G:χ O(G)] is the largest cardinality of an admissibleG-set withk-orbits,
we deduce that|T /G|> k. SinceM is geometric, we therefore deduce
[N T S1,Σ kHM ]G ∼= [ΦGN T S1,Σ kHM (G/G)] ∼= [S|T /G|,Σ kHM (G/G)] = 0.
This shows thatHM is ak[G:χ O(G)]-slice.□
2.2.RewritingO-slice connectivity.Putting these together, we get the full
O-slice version of [4, Theorem 2.5].
Theorem 2.7.AG-spectrumEis inτ O
≥n if and only if for allH⊂G,
[H:χ O(H)]·gconn (E)(H)≥n.
Proof.The proof is essentially that of [4, Theorem 2.5]. The forward direction is
Lemma 2.3.
For the other direction, letEbe a spectrum with the prescribed geometric
connectivities. Consider the isotropy separation sequence
EP+ ⊗E→E→ ˜EP ⊗E.
By Lemma 2.6, theO-slice connectivity of ˜EP ⊗Eis at leastn. By induction on
the subgroup lattice, Lemma 2.5 shows thatEP + ⊗Ealso hasO-slice connectivity
n. Since localizing categories are closed under extensions, this implies thatEhas
O-slice connectivityn.□
Rewriting this slightly, we have a way to describe the slice connectivity of an
arbitrary 0-connective spectrum.
Corollary 2.8.IfE∈ Sp G
≥0, then let
n= min
H⊆G

[H:χ O(H)]·gconn (E)(H)
	
.
ThenE∈τ O
≥n.
