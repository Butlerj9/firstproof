(Lack of) quasi-shift invariance of theΦ 4
3 measure
Martin Hairer
1 Question
Let T3 be the three dimensional unit size torus and letµ be the Φ4
3 measure on the space
of distributions D′(T3). Let ψ:T 3 →R be a smooth function that is not identically
zero and let Tψ :D ′(T3)→ D ′(T3) be the shift map given by Tψ(u)=u+ψ (with
the usual identification of smooth functions as distributions). Prove or disprove the
statement “the measures µ and T ∗
ψµ are equivalent”. Here, equivalence of measures is
in the sense of having the same null sets andT ∗
ψ denotes the pushforward underT ψ.
2 Some Context
One of the very few interacting quantum field theories that can be rigorously constructed
is the so-called (bosonic)Φ4 theory in (space-time) dimensions2 and 3. It has long been
known that in dimension2 and finite volume there is a natural identification between the
Hilbert space of the interacting theory and that of the corresponding free theory. On the
other hand, Glimm [Gli68] observed that this is no longer the case in dimension 3. At
the level of the corresponding Euclidean theories (which are represented by probability
measures on the space of Schwartz distributions on the corresponding space-time), this
translates into the fact that the Φ4 measure µ and the corresponding free field measure
νare equivalent in dimension2but mutually singular in dimension3. In fact, there is
a sense in which the dimension that delimits between the two behaviors is 8/3. It is
then natural to ask in which dimensions µ has the weaker property that µ and T ∗
ψµ are
equivalent for smooth ψ. Here it turns out that the borderline dimension is 3, and the
question probes on which side it falls.
2.1 An incorrect heuristic
Regarding the proof, a tempting heuristic is to use the fact that one should think of µ as
having the density with respect to “Lebesgue measure on D′” (which of course doesn’t
exist) proportional to
exp

Notations2
where C is a (diverging) constant of the formC= 3c 1 −9c 2, where c1 is the expectation
of |Φ(x)|2 under the free field measure ν (which is of course infinite) and c2 is an
additional logarithmically divergent constant. The density of T ∗
ψµ with respect to µ is
then formally given by

dx

,
Since the terms on the first line are well-defined for smoothψ and one expectsΦ3 −3c 1Φ
and Φ2 −c 1 to be quite well-behaved, the additional logarithmically divergent terms
proportional to c2 cause this “density” to diverge, suggesting (correctly) thatµ and T ∗
ψµ
are mutually singular.
There are at least two problems with such an approach. First,Φ3 −3c1Φ does actually
notdefine a random distribution, whether Ψ is distributed according to µ or to the free
field ν (which guides the heuristic). This is because if it were, it would have a covariance
behaving like |x−y| −3 around the diagonal, which is not integrable in dimension 3.
The second problem is that such an argument suggests that, if µn = exp(−fn)ν for
some “nice” probability measure ν and functions fn that fail to converge to a “nice”
limit, then µn fails to converge to a limit µ. This of course is not true: for a suitable
(diverging) sequence of constants cn, the sequence fn(x)=c n +ncos(nx) is such that
if ν is Lebesgue measure on [0,1] , then µn converges weakly to Lebesgue measure
even though the log-densities fn fail to converge. Any proof needs to be based on a
different approach or to satisfactorily address these problems.
Acknowledgement
The proof presented below is a simplified version of an argument that will appear as part of a
joint publication with Jacopo Peroni. This in turn is based on the article [HKN24].
3 Notations
We fix a space-time white noise ξ on R×T 3. We define as the stationary solution to
the linear equation
(∂t + 1−∆) =ξ,onR×T 3 .
(We use the convention that symbols represent random space-time distributions rather
than elements of a regularity structure.) Starting from this process, we define and
as its Wick square and cube respectively, which are given by

H3( N , cN ),
where N =P N and cN =E 2
N (which is constant in space and time). Here, PN
denotes the projection onto Fourier modes with |k| ≤N and Hn denotes the nth

for a normal random variable Z. The first convergence takes place in the space of
continuous functions of time with values inC−1−2κ, while the second convergence takes
place in the space-time parabolic spaceC − 3
2 −3κ.
With these notations in place, we define as the stationary solution to
(∂t + 1−∆) = ,
and similarly for . For a more comprehensive and pedagogical introduction to the
general tree-like notation, we refer the reader to [ MWX17]. We also write “ ≺” for
Bony’s paraproduct (in space) as defined for example in [GIP15, Sec. 2.1] and, given
a random N-dependent process w, we will sometimes use the physicists shorthand
notation:w k:instead ofH k(w, cN ).
4 Solution and Proof
The statement isfalse. In particular, for any smooth function ψ̸≡0 and any choice of
the parameters involved in the definition ofµ (mass and coupling constant, provided
that the latter is non-zero), the measuresµandT ∗
ψµare mutually singular.
For notational simplicity, we fix the mass and the coupling constant to1, but this
has no incidence on the proof. Our main starting point is the following statement, a
proof of which can be found for example in [ HM18] and [EW24, Lemma 4.19] for
(4.1), combined with [CC18] for (4.2) (see Ansatz 2.11 there). Throughout this proof,
κ >0is chosen small enough (κ= 1/100is certainly sufficient).
Proposition 4.1.There exists a stationary process v that is almost surely continuous in
time with values inC 1−2κ(Td)and such that the process
u= − +v ,(4.1)
is stationary with fixed time distribution equal to µ. Furthermore, the process v is such
that
v=−3((v− )≺ ) +v ♯ ,(4.2)
wherev ♯ is continuous with values inC 1+4κ(Td).
It was furthermore shown in [HKN24, Lemmas 3.1 & 3.4] (but see [Hai14] for a
similar result using a slightly different regularisation) that the processes and are
almost surely continuous in time with values inC − 1
2 −κ andC
1
2 −3κ respectively.
Before we proceed, we remind some notations and preliminary results. First of all,
we define the additional diverging constant
cN,2 :=E[ N N],(4.3)

which will be used to distinguish between the shifted and the non-shifted measures.
We will also use the following two technical lemmas whose proofs can be found in
Section 4.1. These are very similar to [HKN24, Lemma 3.11 and Lemma 3.12].
Lemma 4.2.Letγ > 1
2. Then, for any fixedt >0,
lim
N→∞
(logN) −γ:( N)3:(t)= 0
almost surely inC − 3
2 (T3)and inL p(Ω;C − 3
2 (T3))for anyp >0.
Lemma 4.3.ForNlarge, one hasc N,2 ≳logN.
The following results are essentially standard, but we recall their statements for
later reference.
Lemma 4.4.For any polynomial P , the expression N P( N ) converges almost surely
to some finite limit inC − 1
2 −κ.
Proof. By paralinearisation and standard commutator estimates (see [GIP15, Lems 2.4
& 2.6]) it suffices to consider the case P(x)=x . This is by now standard, see for
example [CC18, Sec. 4.4].
Lemma 4.5.Let v be a process satisfying the decomposition(4.2). Then, the expressions
: 2
N: N −3c N,2 N and : 2
N:vN + 3cN,2(vN − N ) both converge almost surely to finite
limits inC −1−2κ asN→ ∞.
Proof. Regarding the first expression, its convergence was essentially for example in
[CC18, Sec. 4.6]. (The approximation used there is slightly different, but the differences
are unimportant.) Regarding the second expression, the claim follows from [ CC18,
Sec. 4.5] (modulo again unimportant changes in the approximation scheme), combined
with the commutator estimate [GIP15, Lem. 2.4].
We now turn to the proof of the main claim. For this, we first claim that if u is as in
(4.1), then, for any fixedt, one has u(t)∈B γ. Indeed, writing uN as a shorthand for

The first term (logN) −γ: 3

Lemma 4.2 (given that γ > 1
2), standard product estimates (e.g. [Bon81, Theorem 2.5]
or [MWX17, Proposition 2.3]) and Lemma 4.4.
It therefore remains to show that −: 2
N: N + : 2
N:vN + 3cN,2uN also converges to
zero almost surely in the sense of distributions. We rewrite this term as
: 2
N:vN + 3cN,2(vN − N )−(: 2
N: N −3c N,2 N).
By Lemma 4.5 we know that this expression converges to an element ofC−1−2κ(Td),

almost surely, thus proving thatµ(B γ)= 1.
In order to conclude the proof, it suffices to show that u+ψ̸∈B γ. For this, we
expand similarly to before the expression appearing in this event as
(logN) −γH3 ((uN +ψ N) ;cN) +(logN) −γ9cN,2 (uN +ψ N)

+(logN) −γ (ψN)3 +(logN) −γ9cN,2ψN .
The sum of the first two terms was just shown to converge to 0 almost surely in
C− 3
2 −3κ(Td)forN→ ∞.
Since :u2
N: and uN both converge to finite distributional limits almost surely by
Lemma 4.4, the next three terms also converge to0almost surely.

Solution and Proof6
Concerning the last element however, we know from Lemma 4.3 that
(logN) −γ cN,2 ≳(logN) −γ+1 .
Since the contribution of this term to the expression in the eventB γ is given by
9 (logN) −γ cN,2⟨ψN , ψ⟩,
and since ⟨ψN , ψ⟩ → ∥ψ∥ 2 >0 , this diverges, whence we conclude that u+ψ̸∈B γ
and therefore(T ∗
ψµ)(Bγ)= 0, so thatT ∗
ψµandµare mutually singular.
4.1 Proof of the lemmas
Proof of Lemma 4.2. We use the embedding W β,2p ,→W β− d
2p ,∞ ,→ C β− d
2p , with
β=− d

Gaussian polynomials, one has

the desired result follows from a standard Borel–Cantelli argument.
Next, we prove Lemma 4.3, which provides a lower bound on the parameterγ. This
bound ensures that the event Aγ (or Bγ) is distinguishable under the shifted measure
when compared to the non-shifted one.
