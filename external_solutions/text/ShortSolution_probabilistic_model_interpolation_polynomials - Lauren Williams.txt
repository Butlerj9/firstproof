1.The problem
Letλ“ pλ 1 ą ¨ ¨ ¨ ąλ n ě0qbe a partition with distinct parts. Assume moreover that
λisrestricted, in the sense that it has a unique part of size0and no part of size1. Does
there exist a nontrivial Markov chain onSnpλqwhose stationary distribution is given by
F ˚
µ px1, . . . , xn;q“1, tq
P ˚
λ px1, . . . , xn;q“1, tq forµPS npλq
whereF ˚
µ px1, . . . , xn;q, tqandP ˚
λ px1, . . . , xn;q, tqare the interpolation ASEP polynomial
and interpolation Macdonald polynomial, respectively? If so, prove that the Markov chain
you construct has the desired stationary distribution. By “nontrivial” we mean that the
transition probabilities of the Markov chain should not be described using the polynomials

2.The solution
The answer to the question is yes, as we explain below. For1ďkďn, we define
(1)p k :“ t´n`1p1´tq
xk ´t ´n`2 PQpt, x 1, . . . , xnqandq k :“ p1´tqx k
xk ´t ´n`2 PQpt, x 1, . . . , xnq.
If0ătă1andx i ąt ´n`1 for1ďiďn, thenp k andq k are probabilities.
Definition 2.1.Fix a partitionλ“ pλ 1 ě ¨ ¨ ¨ ěλ nqwithλ n “0. Theinterpolation
t-Push TASEPwithcontentλis a Markov chain onS npλq; we think of its states as
configurations of particles on a ring labeled byλ1, . . . , λn, where stateηcorresponds to
having a particle labeledη j at positionj. Moreover, there is abellattached to each
particle. The transitions fromηPS npλqare as follows.
(Step 0) The bell at positionjrings with probability

(Step 1) The particle at positionj, say with labela, is activated, and starts traveling
clockwise according to the rules of thet-Push TASEP. That is, suppose there
arem“weaker” particles in the system, i.e. particles whose labels are less thana,
including vacancies (label0). Then with probabilitytk´1
rmst
the activated particle will
move to the location of thekth of these weaker particles. If this location contains
a particle with positive label, then that particle becomes active, and chooses a
weaker particle to displace in the same way. The procedure continues until the
active particle arrives at a vacancy. At the end of this step, positionjis vacant,
and we regard this vacancy as a particle labeleda:“0.
(Step 2) The particle labeleda:“0now goes to position1and starts traveling clockwise.
When it gets to sitekfor1ďkďj´1containing a particle with labelbě0, it
skips over that site with probability1´pk ifběa, and1´q k ifbăa; otherwise
it settles at that site, activating/ displacing the site’s particle. Once it activates a
new particle, the old particle settles at sitekand the new active particle continues
to travel clockwise towards positionj, activating a new particle according to the
rule above. The active particle stops once it displaces/activates another particle
or arrives at positionj, in which case it settles in positionj.
We denote the resulting configuration byνand the transition probability byPpη, νq.
Moreover, we letPp1q
λ,j “P p1q

λ,j “P p2q
j denote the transition probabilities associ-
ated with (Step 1) and (Step 2), respectively. We then have, forµ, νPSnpλq,

Recall the notion of classical two-line queues from [CMW22] and signed two-line queues
from [BDW25] together with their weight functions. (Here we specializeq“1.)
LetQ η

Definition 3.1.Given a signed two-line queueQPG α

version sQobtained by forgetting the signs of the balls in the top row. The composition
we read in the bottom row (respectively the top row) ofsQisµ(respectively∥α∥q, where
∥α∥“ p|α 1|, . . . ,|αn|q.
We then define sGκ
µ as the set of paired ball systems obtained by applying this operation
onQPG α

This leads us to define the following weights. FixsQP sGκ

where the sum is taken over all signed two-line queuesQfrom which sQis obtained by

Proof.We consider all the possible ways of “adding signs” to the balls in the top row of
sQto obtain a signed two-line queue. Fix such a ballBlabeledaą0:
‚ifBhas below it a vacancy or a ball labeledbăa, then we must assign a´sign
toB.
‚ifBhas a ball labeledbąabelow it, then we must assign a`sign toB.
‚ifBhas a ball labeledb“abelow it, then we can giveBa`or´sign.
We then check that the possible signs for each ballBis consistent with the choice of
weights in Equation (6). In particular, one notices that when a ballBis given a´sign,
the ball weight should be multiplied by´1when we go fromsQtoQ, but the weight of
the pairing connected toBis also multiplied by´1.□

LetG η be the top homogeneous part ofG˚

The following is an analogue of [AMW25, Theorem 4.18], and can be proved in essen-
tially the same way, using interpolation analogues of results from [AS19].

Proof.Letλandκbe the two partitions obtained by reorderingρandη, respectively.
Consider the weakly order-preserving functionϕ:iÞÑmaxpi´1,0q. We then have
ϕpρq “η. Sinceλdoes not have parts of size 1, andϕis bijective fromt0,2,3, . . .uto

wherec ρ
ν is the coefficient from Equation(7), i.e. the generating function for the setsGρ
ν.
The idea of the proof below is that a signed two-line queue encodes Step 2 of the
interpolationt-Push TASEP.
Proof.Note that (Step 2) of Definition 2.1 is encoded by an element of a setsGρ
ν (see Defi-
nition 3.1). Indeed, the transition in (Step 2) from the configurationρto the configuration
νis possible if and only there is an elementsQin sGρ
ν (recall that this set contains at most
one element). More precisely, a particle labeledaą0which moved from positionkPJnK
to a positionk 1, corresponds to a non trivial pairing insQconnecting a ball labeledain
columnkof the top row to a ball labeledain columnk 1 of the bottom row. Particles
which do not move correspond to trivial pairings.
We now claim thatwtp sQqdivided byD:“ ś

inwtp sQq, divided by one of the factors inD, equals one of the skipping/ displacement
probabilities from Item (Step 2) (whose product isPp2q
j pρ, νq). Note that in what follows,
instead of associating the weightp1´tqtskipppq to each nontrivial pairing, we will associate
p1´tqto the top ball in each nontrivial pairing, and a factor oftto each skipped ball.
