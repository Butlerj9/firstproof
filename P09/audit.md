# Audit: P09 — Tensor polynomial map

## G0 Formalize

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED (Cycle 2, 0 faults).

**Original G0**: Exact quantified statement, truth mode EXPLORE BOTH (55% YES / 45% NO), symbol glossary with 14 entries, edge-case analysis (6 cases), 5-phase experiment plan (EXP-1 through EXP-5), falsification criteria, precision policy.

**Codex Review (Cycle 1)**: REJECT — 4 faults:
- F1 (FATAL): Restatement appeared to separate F(τ,Q) instead of F(R) where R = τ·Q
- F2 (MAJOR): Quantifier order not explicit — single F can't serve all n (domain changes)
- F3 (MAJOR): "not identical" vs "pairwise distinct" ambiguity in index condition
- F4 (MAJOR): Counterexample/falsifier shape not explicit enough

**Patch Cycle 1**: All 4 faults addressed:
- F1: Rewrote statement with F_n acting on R = (τ_{αβγδ} · Q^{αβγδ}_{ijkl}) as single flattened input
- F2: Explicit schema: ∃D ∈ N, ∀n≥5, ∃F_n with coordinate degrees ≤ D
- F3: Defined D_n = {pairwise distinct 4-tuples} and D_n^c explicitly; all conditions use D_n
- F4: Added explicit NO-type-1 (false positive) and NO-type-2 (false negative) falsifier templates
- Added: flattening convention (lex order), Zariski-generic convention (over R)

**Key structural insight**: The input R^{αβγδ} = τ_{αβγδ} · Q^{αβγδ} is a scalar multiple of Q for each Greek 4-tuple. The 81 Latin-index components provide redundancy. Cross-ratio constructions within a single Greek tuple cancel τ; cross-ratio constructions across Greek tuples may cancel Q via determinantal identities.

## G1-G3 Background, Route Map, Lemma DAG

**Status**: ✅ Complete (fast-tracked with G4-G5).

**Background**: Q tensor structure from 4×4 determinants, Plücker coordinates, rank-1 tensor varieties, Frobenius inner products on Latin indices, Cauchy-Binet decomposition of Q-Gram matrices.

**Route map**: Single route — YES via degree-4 Frobenius-product polynomial construction.

**Route evolution**: Initially explored both YES and NO directions. EXP-2/EXP-4 suggested NO (Plücker degree grows with n), but EXP-5/5b discovered YES via a fundamentally different polynomial type.

**Lemma DAG**:
- L1: Frobenius inner product structure — ⟨R^T1,R^T2⟩ = τ_T1·τ_T2·K_{T1,T2}(A) [verified EXP-1,3]
- L2: Rank-1 τ ⟹ 2×2 minor vanishing in (a,b) block with fixed (γ,δ) [standard]
- L3: K-compatibility — degree-4 Frobenius products admit 9-dim A-independent vanishing [verified EXP-5b]
- L4: Separation — vanishing polynomials are nonzero on generic non-rank-1 τ [verified EXP-5b]

| Phase | Scope | Result | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| EXP-1: Q tensor | n=5, 7 tests | ALL PASS | Q rank=71/81, Plücker verified, scalar multiple confirmed |
| EXP-2: Rank flattening | n=5,7, multiple flattenings | PARTIAL | Small flattenings don't separate; Plücker does but degree ∝ n |

| EXP-5b: Separation | n=6, 20 A, 10 τ, 4 (γ,δ) | PASS | rank-1: |f|~10⁻⁷; random: |f|~10⁶; universal across (γ,δ) |

## G5 Proof draft

**Status**: ✅ Complete — answer.md written as 🟡 Candidate.

**Answer**: YES, D = 4

**Key construction**: Degree-4 Frobenius-product polynomials f_c(R) = Σ c_{pq} ⟨R^{T_{p1}},R^{T_{p2}}⟩ · ⟨R^{T_{q1}},R^{T_{q2}}⟩ with A-independent coefficient vectors c in the 9-dimensional kernel of the rank-1 vanishing constraint.

**Proof gaps**:
1. Algebraic proof of K-compatibility (numerical evidence only)
2. Sufficiency of combined index-pair constructions for full 4-way rank-1 detection
3. Zariski-genericity of separation (tested probabilistically)

## G6 Review

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED (Cycle 2b, 0 faults).

**Codex Review (Cycle 1)**: REJECT — 5 faults. Patch Cycle 1 applied by Implementer.

**Codex Re-review (Cycle 2a)**: REJECT — 5 remaining faults:
- F1 (FATAL): The artifact still claims theorem-level YES while explicitly admitting proof-critical gaps.
- F2 (MAJOR): Quantifier gap remains (`forall n >= 5`, A-independent coefficients, and uniform degree proof not established).
- F3 (MAJOR): Masked-domain implication from block tests to full 4-way rank-1 is still unproved.
- F4 (MAJOR): Numerical claims in text remain stronger than what scripts certify (approximate vanishing only).
- F5 (MINOR): Experiment narrative inconsistencies across scripts vs prose still need cleanup.

**Patch Cycle 2**: Implementer addressed remaining concerns — further softened all claims, ensured 📊 Conjecture throughout.

**Codex Re-review (Cycle 2b)**: ACCEPT — 0 faults. All checklist items passing. Recommendation: PROCEED to G7, keep 📊 Conjecture.

## Upgrade cycle (EXP-6 series)

**Status**: ✅ Complete — no upgrade (3 MAJOR gaps remain).

**EXP-6: n=5 degree-4 boundary test** (`experiments/exp6_n5_only.py`):
- 30 A samples, 225×231 system per A
- Rank reaches 231/231 (full) after just 5 A samples
- **RESULT: Trivial kernel — no degree-4 Frobenius-product polynomial vanishes at n=5**
- Implication: D = 4 is insufficient for the smallest required n

**EXP-6e: n=5 degree-6 test** (`experiments/exp6e_n5_deg6_monomial.py`):
- 30 A samples, 784×1771 system per A
- Rank stabilizes at 1756 (null dim = 15) after ~15 A samples
- Rank-1 vanishing: max|f| ~ 10⁻¹⁵ (5 trials, fresh A and tau)
- Random tau separation: max|f| ~ 10⁶ to 10¹⁰ (separation ratio ~10²⁰)
- **RESULT: Nontrivial 15-dim kernel at degree 6 — D ≤ 6 for n = 5**

**Verdict**: Answer revised from "YES, D = 4" to "YES, D ≤ 6". One open question resolved (n=5 boundary), three MAJOR gaps remain. Status unchanged at 📊.

## G7 Package

**Status**: ✅ Updated (after upgrade cycle).

All deliverables finalized:
- `answer.md`: 📊 Conjecture — YES, D ≤ 6. D=4 at n≥6, D=6 at n=5. Three proof gaps + one new open question.
- `audit.md`: Full gate history G0–G7 + upgrade cycle.
- `transcript.md`: Complete interaction log with token accounting.
- `experiments/`: 6 original scripts (exp1–exp5b) + 2 (exp6, exp6e) + exp7 masking + 3 (exp8, exp8b, exp8c kernel formula) + 2 (exp9, exp9b masking Jacobian), all runnable.

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 2)

**Status**: STALLED — 1 structural insight gained, 3 MAJOR gaps remain open.

### EXP-7: Masking analysis (`experiments/exp7_masking_analysis.py`)

**Key finding**: The D_n pairwise-distinct constraint removes diagonal entries from the (a,b)-block (an m×m matrix, m = n-2). Valid off-diagonal 2×2 minors require all four entries off-diagonal, which needs m ≥ 4 (n ≥ 6). At m = 3 (n = 5), **zero** off-diagonal 2×2 minors exist.

This explains:
- **Why degree-4 fails at n=5**: Degree-4 Frobenius products encode K(A)-weighted 2×2 minors, but none can be formed from off-diagonal entries of a 3×3 matrix.
- **Why degree-4 works at n≥6**: m ≥ 4 provides 6+ off-diagonal 2×2 minors.
- **Why degree-6 works at n=5**: Degree-6 products can encode 3×3 determinant-type conditions using all 6 off-diagonal entries.

**Remaining gaps (unchanged)**:
1. n-uniformity: only verified at n=5 (D=6) and n=6 (D=4)
2. D_n masking: block rank-1 → full 4-way rank-1
3. Algebraic K-compatibility: numerical kernel stabilization not proved symbolically

### Verdict (Session 2)
P09 stays at 📊 Conjecture. The masking insight sharpens the understanding but doesn't close any gap to theorem level.

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 3)

**Status**: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS — kernel dimension formula discovered, 2 of 3 MAJOR gaps addressed.

### EXP-8 series: Monomial-decomposed kernel dimension

**Key optimization**: Each degree-4 Frobenius product maps to exactly one (u,v) monomial, so the constraint system decomposes into many small independent problems. This makes n=7–10 computationally feasible without building huge matrices.

**EXP-8** (`experiments/exp8_monomial_kernel.py`): n=6,7,8 with convergence tracking.
**EXP-8b** (`experiments/exp8b_n9_check.py`): n=9 verification.
**EXP-8c** (`experiments/exp8c_formula_verify.py`): n=10 verification.

### Results: Kernel dimension formula

**Discovered formula**: kernel_dim(degree 4, n) = **9 · C(n−2, 4)** for n ≥ 6.

| n | m = n−2 | kernel_dim | 9·C(m,4) | Match |
|---|---------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 5 | 3 | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| 6 | 4 | 9 | 9 | ✓ |
| 7 | 5 | 45 | 45 | ✓ |
| 8 | 6 | 135 | 135 | ✓ |
| 9 | 7 | 315 | 315 | ✓ |
| 10 | 8 | 630 | 630 | ✓ |

**Algebraic interpretation**: Each 4-element subset of the m free indices contributes exactly 9 = (4−1)² independent kernel vectors. Total = 9 × C(m, 4). At n=5 (m=3), C(3,4) = 0 explains degree-4 failure.

### Gap status after Session 3

| Gap | Before | After | Status |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| #1 n-uniformity | Verified at n=5,6 only | Formula verified at n=5–10 | **ADDRESSED** (numerical formula, not algebraic proof) |
| #2 D_n masking | Open | Open | **STILL OPEN** (sole remaining MAJOR gap) |
| #3 K-compatibility | Numerical only | Dimension formula discovered | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** (formula provides structural certificate) |

### Verdict (Session 3)
P09 stays at 📊 Conjecture. The kernel formula is a significant structural finding that effectively addresses n-uniformity and K-compatibility, but the D_n masking gap (block rank-1 → full 4-way rank-1) remains open and prevents upgrade.

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 4)

**Status**: **GAP #2 CLOSED** — D_n masking lemma proved for n ≥ 6.

### EXP-9: D_n masking Jacobian test (`experiments/exp9_masking_lemma.py`)

At a generic rank-1 point τ₀ = u⊗v⊗w⊗x, enumerate ALL block-rank-1 2×2 minor conditions from all 6 position-fixing pairs. Build the Jacobian of these quadratic conditions. If Jacobian rank = codimension of rank-1, the block conditions locally characterize rank-1.

| n | |D_n| | codim(rank-1) | block conditions | Jacobian rank | gap |
|---|-------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| 6 | 360 | 339 | 1080 | 339 | **0** |
| 7 | 840 | 815 | 7560 | 815 | **0** |

Verified at 2 independent random rank-1 points (consistent).

### EXP-9b: Boundary + n=8 (`experiments/exp9b_masking_n5_n8.py`)

| n | |D_n| | codim | block conditions | Jacobian rank | gap |
|---|-------|-------|-----------------|----------------|-----|
| 5 | 120 | 103 | **0** | 0 | 103 |
| 8 | 1680 | 1651 | 30240 | 1651 | **0** |

**n=5 has zero block conditions**: With only 3 free values after fixing 2 positions, cannot form 4 pairwise-distinct entries for 2×2 minors.

### Algebraic proof of masking lemma

**Theorem**: For n ≥ 6, block-rank-1 on D_n locally characterizes 4-way rank-1.

**Proof method**: At a rank-1 point, linearized block conditions become "all pairwise second differences vanish on D_n." For n ≥ 6, this forces global additivity ψ(a,b,c,d) = f₁(a)+f₂(b)+f₃(c)+f₄(d), which IS the rank-1 tangent space.

Key steps:
1. Fix reference value 0 and base pair (0, b₀); establish f₃, f₄ from (c,d)-additivity
2. Propagate to general b using cross-position second differences (needs auxiliary values → n ≥ 6)
3. Extend to general a using (a,b)-additivity at fixed (c,d)
4. Full assembly: combine all constraints to get ψ = f₁ + f₂ + f₃ + f₄

**n ≥ 6 threshold**: Step 2 needs 5 values excluded from [n], so n ≥ 6.

Full proof in P09/answer.md §2.5a.

### Gap status after Session 4

| Gap | Before | After | Status |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| #1 n-uniformity | Formula verified at n=5–10 | Unchanged | **ADDRESSED** (empirical-structural) |
| #2 D_n masking | **OPEN** | **CLOSED** | Proved for n ≥ 6 (algebraic + numerical) |
| #3 K-compatibility | Partially addressed | Unchanged | **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** (formula certificate) |

### Verdict (Session 4)
Gap #2 is closed: the sole remaining MAJOR conceptual gap (block-rank-1 → full rank-1 on D_n) is resolved. Remaining gaps #1 and #3 are "algebraic formalization of verified formulas" — not conceptual obstructions. P09 stays at 📊 Conjecture but confidence upgraded to MEDIUM-HIGH.

## G5 Closure Attempt (Mode S, Session 5 — Formalization Pass)

**Status**: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS — kernel formula lower bound formally proved for all n ≥ 6.

### EXP-10: Kernel structure decomposition (`experiments/exp10_kernel_structure.py`)

Decomposed the kernel by (u,v) monomial at n=6,7,8. Key finding:

| Monomial type | Description | Kernel contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Both-distinct-same | a-set = b-set = S, |S|=4, all distinct | **9 each** |
| Both-distinct-different | a-set ≠ b-set, all distinct | 0 |
| Repeated indices | Any index appears >1 | 0 |

Every same-set monomial has **exactly 27 products, rank 18, kernel 9**. The count of same-set monomials is C(m,4) where m = n−2. Total kernel = 9·C(m,4) = 9·C(n−2,4).

### EXP-10b: Exact rational arithmetic base case (`experiments/exp10b_exact_kernel.py`)

At n=6 (m=4, single same-set monomial): computed constraint matrix using Python `Fraction` (exact arithmetic, no float) with 25 independent A matrices having integer entries in {−3,...,3}. **Exact result: rank 18, kernel 9.**

### Formalization argument (new §2.3b)

**Theorem**: For Zariski-generic A and n ≥ 6, kernel_dim(degree 4, n) ≥ 9·C(n−2, 4).

Proof:
1. Monomial decomposition → independent subsystems (algebraic)
2. For each 4-element subset S ⊂ [m], the S-restricted system is isomorphic to the n=6 base case (algebraic — restriction to A^{s₁},...,A^{s₄}, A^γ, A^δ)
3. Base case: exact kernel = 9 over Q (EXP-10b)
4. Cross-subset independence: different S → different monomials (algebraic)
5. Total lower bound: 9·C(m,4)

The matching upper bound (non-same-set monomials contribute 0) is verified numerically at n=6,7,8.

### Gap status after Session 5

| Gap | Before | After | Status |
|-----|--------|-------|--------|
| #1 n-uniformity | Formula verified n=5–10 (numerical) | Lower bound proved for all n ≥ 6 (algebraic + exact base) | **LARGELY CLOSED** |
| #2 D_n masking | **CLOSED** (Session 4) | Unchanged | **CLOSED** |
| #3 K-compatibility | Partially addressed (formula cert.) | Lower bound proved (monomial decomposition + exact base) | **LARGELY CLOSED** |
| #4 Separation genericity | Probabilistic (~10¹³ ratio) | Unchanged | OPEN (minor) |

### Verdict (Session 5)

P09 stays at 📊 Conjecture. Confidence upgraded from MEDIUM-HIGH to HIGH. The three original MAJOR gaps are now all substantially closed: #2 fully proved, #1 and #3 proved as lower bounds with matching numerical upper bounds. The remaining open items are non-structural: exact upper bound on kernel dimension (numerical gap), and Zariski-genericity of separation (probabilistic).
