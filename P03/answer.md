# P03 — Answer: Markov chain with interpolation ASEP stationary distribution

**Status**: 📊 Conjecture (n=2 proved; n ≥ 3 conjectured with strong numerical evidence)
**Confidence**: HIGH for n=2 (exact symbolic proof); MEDIUM for n ≥ 3 (numerical only)
**Conjectured answer**: **YES** — the ASEP chain with rates (t, 1) conjecturally has stationary distribution π(μ) = f\*\_μ / P\*\_λ = t^{inv(μ)} / [n]\_t!

---

## 1. Statement

### Hypotheses

- λ = (λ₁ > ⋯ > λₙ ≥ 0) is a partition with distinct parts (restricted: unique 0, no 1).
- **t > 0** (required for positivity of transition rates and well-definedness of the distribution).
- x₁, …, xₙ are generic (i.e., C(x, t) ≠ 0; see §2 for the degenerate locus).

### Theorem (n = 2)

For n = 2, λ = (2, 0): the Markov chain on S₂(λ) = {(0,2), (2,0)} with transitions

- swap at rate **t** if μ₁ < μ₂ ("uphill"),
- swap at rate **1** if μ₁ > μ₂ ("downhill"),

has stationary distribution π(μ) = f\*\_μ(x; q=1, t) / P\*\_λ(x; q=1, t) = t^{inv(μ)} / (1+t).

*Proved exactly in §3.*

### Conjecture (general n ≥ 3)

For general n, the Markov chain on Sₙ(λ) with transitions: for each adjacent pair (i, i+1),

- swap μᵢ ↔ μᵢ₊₁ at rate **t** if μᵢ < μᵢ₊₁,
- swap μᵢ ↔ μᵢ₊₁ at rate **1** if μᵢ > μᵢ₊₁,

conjecturally has stationary distribution

$$\pi(\mu) = \frac{f^*_\mu(x_1,\ldots,x_n;\, q=1,\, t)}{P^*_\lambda(x_1,\ldots,x_n;\, q=1,\, t)} = \frac{t^{\mathrm{inv}(\mu)}}{[n]_t!}$$

where inv(μ) = #{(i,j) : i < j, μᵢ > μⱼ} and [n]\_t! = ∏ᵢ₌₁ⁿ⁻¹ (1 + t + ⋯ + tⁱ).

This is the **Mallows distribution** on permutations of λ. *Supported by strong numerical evidence for n = 3 (§4); not yet proved for n ≥ 3.*

### Nontriviality

The transition rates depend only on the values (μᵢ, μᵢ₊₁) at adjacent positions and the parameter t > 0. They do not involve the polynomials f\*\_μ themselves.

## 2. Key identity (proved for n=2; conjectured for n ≥ 3)

Both the theorem and conjecture reduce to a single algebraic identity:

**Identity (proved for n=2; conjectured for n ≥ 3).** For t > 0 and generic x, at q = 1,

$$f^*_\mu(x;\, q=1,\, t) = C(x, t) \cdot t^{\mathrm{inv}(\mu)}$$

for all μ ∈ Sₙ(λ), where C(x, t) is a function independent of μ.

**Degenerate locus.** C(x, t) may vanish at specific (x, t) values. For n = 2: C = (y₁+y₂−1−1/t)² = 0 iff y₁+y₂ = 1+1/t. At such points, all f\*\_μ vanish simultaneously and π(μ) is defined by continuity (as the constant limit t^{inv(μ)}/[n]\_t!).

**Consequence (conditional on the identity).** The ratio f\*\_μ / P\*\_λ = C · t^{inv(μ)} / (C · ∑\_ν t^{inv(ν)}) = t^{inv(μ)} / [n]\_t!, which is independent of x. Since t > 0, all terms t^{inv(μ)} > 0, so [n]\_t! > 0 and π(μ) > 0 for all μ.

**Proof of detailed balance (conditional on the identity).** For any adjacent transposition sᵢ with μᵢ < μᵢ₊₁:

π(μ) · t = (t^{inv(μ)} / [n]\_t!) · t = t^{inv(μ)+1} / [n]\_t! = t^{inv(sᵢμ)} / [n]\_t! = π(sᵢμ) · 1

since inv(sᵢμ) = inv(μ) + 1 when μᵢ < μᵢ₊₁. ∎ (This step is unconditional given the identity.)

## 3. Proof for n = 2

**Setup.** n = 2, λ = (2, 0), anti-dominant λ⁻ = (0, 2). State space S₂(λ) = {(0,2), (2,0)}.

**Step 1: Compute E\*\_{(0,2)}.** The interpolation nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomial E\*\_{(0,2)}(y₁, y₂; q, t) is characterized by:
- leading term y₂²,
- vanishing at spectral vectors of all compositions ν with |ν| ≤ 2, ν ≠ (0,2).

Solving the 5×5 linear system (5 vanishing conditions, 5 lower-degree unknowns) symbolically in SymPy gives:

$$E^*_{(0,2)} = y_2^2 + \frac{(q+1)(t-1)}{q^2t-1} y_1 y_2 + \frac{t-1}{q^2t-1} y_1^2 + \cdots$$

with 5 rational-in-(q,t) coefficients (full expressions in EXP-3b script).

**Step 2: Apply Hecke operator.** f\*\_{(0,2)} = E\*\_{(0,2)} and f\*\_{(2,0)} = T₀(E\*\_{(0,2)}) where

$$T_0 f = t \cdot s_0(f) + (t-1) \cdot \frac{y_1}{y_1 - y_2} (f - s_0 f)$$

**Step 3: Take q → 1 limit.** Using SymPy's `limit`, we obtain:

$$f^*_{(0,2)}(q{=}1) = \left(\frac{t(y_1 + y_2) - t - 1}{t}\right)^{\!2} = \left(y_1 + y_2 - 1 - \frac{1}{t}\right)^{\!2}$$

$$f^*_{(2,0)}(q{=}1) = t \cdot f^*_{(0,2)}(q{=}1)$$

**Verification:** simplify(f\*\_{(2,0)}/t − f\*\_{(0,2)}) = 0 ✓

So C(y₁, y₂, t) = (y₁ + y₂ − 1 − 1/t)², which is a **perfect square** (hence ≥ 0), and:
- π(0,2) = 1/(1+t), π(2,0) = t/(1+t) — Mallows distribution with [2]\_t! = 1+t. ∎

## 4. Numerical evidence for n = 3

**Setup.** n = 3, λ = (3, 2, 0), anti-dominant λ⁻ = (0, 2, 3). |Sₙ(λ)| = 6.

**Method.** Using mpmath with 80 decimal digits:
1. Compute E\*\_{(0,2,3)} at q = 0.9999 via the vanishing characterization (55×55 linear system).
2. Apply Hecke operators by evaluation at 80 grid points + polynomial interpolation.
3. Evaluate f\*\_μ at test points and compare π(μ) with Mallows prediction.

**Inversion counts:**

| μ | inv(μ) | t^{inv} / [3]\_t! (Mallows) |
|---|--------|----------------------------|
| (0,2,3) | 0 | 1 / [3]\_t! |
| (0,3,2) | 1 | t / [3]\_t! |
| (2,0,3) | 1 | t / [3]\_t! |
| (2,3,0) | 2 | t² / [3]\_t! |
| (3,0,2) | 2 | t² / [3]\_t! |
| (3,2,0) | 3 | t³ / [3]\_t! |

where [3]\_t! = (1+t)(1+t+t²).

**Result (t = 0.4, q = 0.9999):**

| μ | π(μ) computed | π(μ) Mallows | Error |
|---|-------------|-------------|-------|
| (0,2,3) | 0.4578828259 | 0.4578754579 | 7.4e-06 |
| (0,3,2) | 0.1831515669 | 0.1831501832 | 1.4e-06 |
| (2,0,3) | 0.1831503978 | 0.1831501832 | 2.1e-07 |
| (2,3,0) | 0.0732598190 | 0.0732600733 | 2.5e-07 |
| (3,0,2) | 0.0732537688 | 0.0732600733 | 6.3e-06 |
| (3,2,0) | 0.0293016216 | 0.0293040293 | 2.4e-06 |

Errors are O(1−q) = O(10⁻⁴), consistent with linear convergence as q → 1. **Note**: These are computed at q = 0.9999, not at exact q = 1. The agreement with the Mallows prediction is numerical evidence, not a proof.

**Convergence rate:** The max deviation |ratio − 1/t| at test points decreases as:

| q | max |ratio − 1/t| |
|---|---|
| 0.9 | 5.8e-01 |
| 0.99 | 3.6e-02 |
| 0.999 | 3.5e-03 |
| 0.9999 | 3.5e-04 |

Linear convergence O(1−q) observed numerically. Result is consistent across t ∈ {0.4, 0.7, 1.5, 3.0} and multiple x-values. **This convergence is numerical evidence supporting the conjecture; it does not constitute a proof that the exact q = 1 limit yields the Mallows distribution for n = 3.**

**C(x,t) constancy check:** f\*\_μ / t^{inv(μ)} is approximately constant across all 6 states to relative deviation ~10⁻⁴ (at q = 0.9999), across all tested x-values. The deviation is consistent with the O(1−q) error from evaluating at q < 1 rather than q = 1.

## 5. Contrast with homogeneous case

The homogeneous ASEP polynomials f\_μ (from E\_μ = x^μ, NOT the interpolation E\*\_μ) do **not** satisfy this identity. The ratio f\_μ/f\_ν for adjacent transpositions is a nontrivial rational function of x (std across test points ~0.3–0.7). The interpolation lower-degree terms are essential.

For n = 2: f\_{(0,2)}/f\_{(2,0)} = y₂²/(y₁(y₁+y₂−ty₂)) ≠ 1/t.

---

## 6. Conjectural mechanism (NOT a proof for n ≥ 3)

The key identity f\*\_μ(q=1) = C(x,t) · t^{inv(μ)} can be *heuristically* understood through the Hecke algebra. **The argument below is a plausibility sketch, not a rigorous proof.** The critical step (Step 1) is unproved for general n.

1. **Conjectural Hecke eigenvalue at q=1 (UNPROVED for n ≥ 3).** At q = 1, the spectral vectors of all compositions with the same multiset of parts collapse. We *conjecture* that the interpolation polynomial E\*\_{λ⁻}(q=1) is a simultaneous eigenvector of the Hecke operators Tᵢ with eigenvalue t whenever (λ⁻)ᵢ < (λ⁻)ᵢ₊₁. For n = 2, this is verified explicitly: T₀(E\*\_{(0,2)})(q=1) = t · E\*\_{(0,2)}(q=1) (proved in §3). For n ≥ 3, this step has not been proved algebraically.

2. **Hecke relation (standard, unconditional).** The quadratic relation Tᵢ² = (t−1)Tᵢ + t holds in the Hecke algebra for all n. If f happens to satisfy Tᵢf = tf, then *conditional on this*, the chain of Hecke applications f\*\_μ = T\_{w\_μ} E\*\_{λ⁻} produces a factor of t at each step, giving f\*\_μ = t^{ℓ(w\_μ)} · E\*\_{λ⁻} = t^{inv(μ)} · E\*\_{λ⁻}.

3. **Mallows distribution (conditional on Steps 1–2).** The resulting π(μ) = t^{inv(μ)}/[n]\_t! is the Mallows distribution on Sₙ, a well-studied object in combinatorics and statistics. This is a valid probability distribution for all t > 0.

## 7. Proof status and gaps

### What is proved

- **n = 2** (§3): The key identity f\*\_μ(q=1) = C(x,t) · t^{inv(μ)} is proved exactly via symbolic computation. C = (y₁+y₂−1−1/t)² is an explicit perfect square. The ASEP chain has stationary distribution π(μ) = t^{inv(μ)}/(1+t) for all t > 0 and generic x.

### What is conjectured (n ≥ 3)

1. **Key identity for general n.** The identity f\*\_μ(q=1) = C(x,t) · t^{inv(μ)} is conjectured based on numerical evidence for n = 3. The Hecke algebra sketch (§6) provides a plausible mechanism but rests on an unproved eigenvalue claim (E\*\_{λ⁻}(q=1) is a Hecke Tᵢ-eigenvector with eigenvalue t).

2. **q → 1 limit existence.** The limit lim\_{q→1} f\*\_μ(x; q, t) is observed to converge numerically (O(1−q) rate) but has not been proved to exist as a polynomial for general n. For n = 2, the limit is computed exactly via SymPy's `limit`.

3. **Positivity of C(x,t).** For n = 2, C ≥ 0 everywhere (perfect square). For general n, C(x,t) > 0 for generic x is expected but not proved. If C = 0 at isolated (x,t) values, the distribution is defined by continuity.

4. **Boundary cases.** The parameter domain t > 0 is required for rates to be positive. At t = 0 or t < 0, the chain and distribution are not well-defined. No analysis has been done at t = ∞ (which would give π concentrated on the identity permutation).
