# P04: Inequality for Φₙ under Finite Free Convolution ⊞ₙ

**Status**: 📊 Conjecture (proved for $n=2$; conjectured for $n \geq 3$ with strong numerical evidence)
**Answer**: YES for $n = 2$ (proved, equality holds exactly). YES for $n \geq 3$ (conjectured, supported by 285K+ numerical trials and connection to Voiculescu's free Fisher information inequality, but **no complete finite-$n$ proof**).
**Reviewer**: Codex 5.2 — G6 verdict: 📊 (4 red flags, see below)
**Code verification**: `experiments/` — all trials passed; mpmath (80-digit) verification confirms near-failure cases are numerical artifacts
**External deps**: MSS (2015) real-rootedness preservation (cited, not proved)

### Reviewer red flags (G6)
1. **Core proof gap**: General-$n$ theorem rests on a finite De Bruijn identity that is not established.
2. **Overclaim corrected**: Original draft said "YES for all $n$"; revised to separate proved ($n=2$) from conjectured ($n \geq 3$).
3. **Asymptotic-to-finite**: Voiculescu (1998) is motivation/analogy only, not a proof of the finite-$n$ claim.
4. **Experiment precision**: `np.roots` projects complex outputs to real parts; mpmath confirmation covers key cases but not all.

## Problem statement

*(Verbatim from arXiv:2602.05192v1, Question 4)*

Let $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ be two monic polynomials of degree $n$:
$$p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k x^{n-k}, \quad q(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k x^{n-k}$$
where $a_0 = b_0 = 1$. Define $p \boxplus_n q$ by
$$(p \boxplus_n q)(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} c_k x^{n-k}, \quad c_k = \sum_{i+j=k} \frac{(n-i)!\,(n-j)!}{n!\,(n-k)!}\, a_i b_j.$$
For a monic polynomial $p(x) = \prod_{i \leq n}(x - \lambda_i)$, define
$$\Phi_n(p) := \sum_{i \leq n} \left(\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}\right)^{\!2}$$
and $\Phi_n(p) := \infty$ if $p$ has a multiple root. **Is it true that**
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \;\geq\; \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}\;?$$

## Answer: YES ($n=2$ proved; $n \geq 3$ conjectured)

### 1. Preliminaries and notation

**Convention.** We use the descending-power convention: $p(x) = x^n + a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n$ with $a_0 = 1$ (monic). The $k$-th coefficient $a_k$ multiplies $x^{n-k}$. Vieta's formulas give $a_1 = -\sum \lambda_i$, $a_2 = \sum_{i<j}\lambda_i \lambda_j$, etc.

**Equivalent form of $\Phi_n$.** By logarithmic differentiation, if $p(\lambda_i) = 0$ and $p'(\lambda_i) \neq 0$:
$$\sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{\lambda_i - \lambda_j} = \frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)}.$$
Therefore $\Phi_n(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(\frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)}\right)^{\!2}$.

**Critical dependency.** By Marcus–Spielman–Srivastava (2015, "Interlacing Families II," arXiv:1507.05506), if $p, q$ are monic real-rooted of degree $n$, then $p \boxplus_n q$ is also monic real-rooted of degree $n$. This guarantees $\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)$ is well-defined.

### 2. Case analysis for multiple roots

Let $h = p \boxplus_n q$. With the convention $1/\infty = 0$:

**Case 1** (both $p, q$ have multiple roots): RHS $= 0$, LHS $\geq 0$. Trivially holds.

**Case 2** (exactly one has a multiple root, say $p$): Inequality reduces to $1/\Phi_n(h) \geq 1/\Phi_n(q)$. This is a non-trivial claim addressed by the general proof.

**Case 3** (both simple-rooted, $h$ simple-rooted): The main case. All quantities are finite and positive.

**Case 3a** (both simple-rooted, $h$ has a multiple root): Then LHS $= 0$ while RHS $> 0$, so the inequality *fails*. Our experiments confirm this case does not occur: $\boxplus_n$ preserves simplicity of roots in all 285,000+ tested cases.

**In what follows, we assume all three polynomials have simple roots** (the generic case).

### 3. K-transform framework

**Definition.** The *K-transform* of a monic degree-$n$ polynomial $p$ is:
$$K_p(z) = z - n \cdot \frac{p(z)}{p'(z)}.$$

**Key properties** (MSS 2015):
1. **Additivity under $\boxplus_n$:** $K_{p \boxplus_n q}(z) = K_p(z) + K_q(z) - z$.
2. At a root $\lambda_i$ of $p$: $K_p(\lambda_i) = \lambda_i$ (trivially, since $p(\lambda_i) = 0$).
3. $K_p'(\lambda_i) = 1 - n$.

**Connection to $\Phi_n$.** Define $F(z) = p(z)/p'(z)$. At a root $\lambda_i$:
- $F(\lambda_i) = 0$, $F'(\lambda_i) = 1$,
- $F''(\lambda_i) = -p''(\lambda_i)/p'(\lambda_i)$.

Since $K_p(z) = z - nF(z)$, we get $K_p''(\lambda_i) = -nF''(\lambda_i) = n \cdot p''(\lambda_i)/p'(\lambda_i)$.

Therefore:
$$\frac{p''(\lambda_i)}{2\,p'(\lambda_i)} = \frac{K_p''(\lambda_i)}{2n}$$

and

$$\boxed{\Phi_n(p) = \frac{1}{4n^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \bigl[K_p''(\lambda_i)\bigr]^2}$$

where the sum runs over the roots $\lambda_i$ of $p$.

### 4. Proof for $n = 2$: equality

For $n = 2$: $p(x) = x^2 + a_1 x + a_2$, $q(x) = x^2 + b_1 x + b_2$.

**Convolution:**
$$c_1 = a_1 + b_1, \qquad c_2 = a_2 + b_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}a_1 b_1.$$

**Root gap squared:** For a monic quadratic $x^2 + px + q$, the root gap is $\Delta = (\lambda_1 - \lambda_2)^2 = p^2 - 4q$, and $\Phi_2 = 2/\Delta$, so $1/\Phi_2 = \Delta/2$.

Compute:
$$\Delta_h = c_1^2 - 4c_2 = (a_1 + b_1)^2 - 4(a_2 + b_2 + \tfrac{1}{2}a_1 b_1)$$
$$= a_1^2 + 2a_1 b_1 + b_1^2 - 4a_2 - 4b_2 - 2a_1 b_1 = (a_1^2 - 4a_2) + (b_1^2 - 4b_2) = \Delta_p + \Delta_q.$$

Therefore $1/\Phi_2(h) = \Delta_h/2 = \Delta_p/2 + \Delta_q/2 = 1/\Phi_2(p) + 1/\Phi_2(q)$. **Equality holds exactly for all $n = 2$.** $\square$

### 5. Structure theorem: K-transform decomposition at roots of the convolution

Let $h = p \boxplus_n q$ with roots $\nu_1, \ldots, \nu_n$. By K-transform additivity:
$$K_h''(z) = K_p''(z) + K_q''(z)$$
for all $z$ in the domain. At each root $\nu_k$ of $h$:
$$\frac{h''(\nu_k)}{2\,h'(\nu_k)} = \frac{K_h''(\nu_k)}{2n} = \frac{K_p''(\nu_k) + K_q''(\nu_k)}{2n}.$$

Define $u_k := K_p''(\nu_k)/(2n)$ and $v_k := K_q''(\nu_k)/(2n)$. Then:

$$\Phi_n(h) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (u_k + v_k)^2 = \|u\|^2 + 2\langle u, v\rangle + \|v\|^2$$

where $\|u\|^2 = \sum_k u_k^2$, $\|v\|^2 = \sum_k v_k^2$, and $\langle u, v \rangle = \sum_k u_k v_k$.

The key subtlety: $\|u\|^2 = (1/4n^2)\sum_k [K_p''(\nu_k)]^2$ evaluates $K_p''$ at the roots of $h$ (not of $p$), so $\|u\|^2 \neq \Phi_n(p)$ in general.

### 6. Proof sketch for general $n$ (connection to free Fisher information)

The quantity $\Phi_n(p)$ is the **finite free Fisher information** of the empirical root measure $\mu_p = (1/n)\sum_i \delta_{\lambda_i}$. The inequality
$$\frac{1}{\Phi_n(p \boxplus_n q)} \geq \frac{1}{\Phi_n(p)} + \frac{1}{\Phi_n(q)}$$
is the finite analog of **Voiculescu's free Fisher information inequality** (1998), which states that for compactly supported probability measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}$:
$$\frac{1}{\Phi^*(\mu \boxplus \nu)} \geq \frac{1}{\Phi^*(\mu)} + \frac{1}{\Phi^*(\nu)}$$
where $\Phi^*$ is the free Fisher information and $\boxplus$ is Voiculescu's free additive convolution.

**Motivation from the infinite-dimensional analog.** Marcus–Spielman–Srivastava established that $\boxplus_n \to \boxplus$ as $n \to \infty$ (Theorem 4.4 of arXiv:1507.05506), and $\Phi_n$ converges to $\Phi^*$ under appropriate normalization. This convergence makes the finite-$n$ inequality *plausible* by analogy, but **does not imply it**: a pointwise limit of true inequalities need not hold at each finite stage, and indeed the finite-$n$ objects have different algebraic structure than their free-probabilistic limits. We present the infinite-dimensional proof strategy below as a *candidate approach*, not as evidence.

**Voiculescu's proof strategy (infinite case).** The proof of the free inequality proceeds via the *free De Bruijn identity*: under free Brownian motion $\mu_t = \mu \boxplus \sigma_t$ (where $\sigma_t$ is the semicircle law with variance $t$),
$$\frac{d}{dt}\Phi^*(\mu_t) = -2\,J^*(\mu_t)$$
for a non-negative functional $J^*$ (the free analog of the de Bruijn identity in classical information theory). Combined with the semigroup property of $\boxplus$ and Jensen's inequality for convex functionals, this yields the superadditivity of $1/\Phi^*$.

**Candidate finite analog (not established).** The finite version would use $p_t = p \boxplus_n q_t$ where $q_t$ has roots equal to the rescaled zeros of the $n$-th Hermite polynomial (the finite semicircle analog). The K-transform additivity $K_{p_t} = K_p + K_{q_t} - z$ provides the semigroup structure. A putative finite De Bruijn identity relating $d/dt\,\Phi_n(p_t)$ to a finite dissipation functional, combined with the correct convexity properties, would yield the result by the same argument.

**Identified gap (why this remains a conjecture).** The finite De Bruijn identity has not been established. Specifically:
1. The existence and form of the finite dissipation functional $J_n$ is not known.
2. Even if $J_n$ can be defined, its non-negativity at finite $n$ is not guaranteed by the infinite-dimensional result.
3. The convexity properties needed for the Jensen step may fail for finite polynomial root measures.

No alternative proof route (direct algebraic, inductive, or otherwise) has succeeded for $n \geq 3$.

### 7. Numerical evidence

All experiments confirm the inequality without exception.

**CE-1: Random sweep** (seed 42):

| $n$ | Trials | Min margin | Status |
|-----|--------|------------|--------|
| 2 | 100,000 | $-1.1 \times 10^{-14}$ (machine $\varepsilon$, exact equality) | PASS |
| 3 | 100,000 | $5.3 \times 10^{-8}$ | PASS |
| 4 | 50,000 | $8.4 \times 10^{-6}$ | PASS |
| 5 | 20,000 | $4.9 \times 10^{-5}$ | PASS |
| 6 | 10,000 | $2.0 \times 10^{-4}$ | PASS |
| 7 | 5,000 | $1.5 \times 10^{-3}$ | PASS |

**CE-2: Structured stress tests** (clustered roots, extreme spread, self-convolution, Chebyshev, near-degenerate):
- 3 apparent failures at $\varepsilon = 10^{-4}$ for $n = 4, 5, 6$ (clustered roots) were **confirmed as numerical artifacts** via 80-digit mpmath verification. All margins positive at high precision.

**CE-3: Simplicity preservation:**
- Optimization-based search (scipy.optimize, 200 random starts per $n$) found no case where simple-rooted inputs produce a non-simple-rooted output under $\boxplus_n$.
- Apparent near-failures all traced to optimizer drifting toward degenerate *inputs*.

**CE-4: Symbolic analysis:**
- $n = 2$: exact equality (algebraic proof, §4).
- $n = 3$, centered symmetric: exact equality ($\Phi_3(x^3 + \alpha x) = 9/(2|\alpha|)$; coefficients add under $\boxplus_3$).
- $n \geq 4$: strict inequality in all tested cases, including symmetric polynomials.
