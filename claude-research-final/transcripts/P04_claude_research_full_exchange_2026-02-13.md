Purpose: Preserve complete intake context for audit and replay.

## Intake context

User provided a full Claude Research write-up titled around "Novel techniques for the finite free Fisher information inequality," with:

1. a literature-status framing,
2. a finite De Bruijn / heat-flow interpretation,
3. three ranked closure strategies,
4. concrete computational recommendations for the `n=4` blocker.

## Core response content (structured capture)

### A) Landscape claim

1. No published direct solution to the specific finite free Fisher inequality was identified in the response.
2. The response positions the target as a new finite analog problem.

### B) Structural interpretation claim

1. Response proposes a finite De Bruijn-type relation linking root-flow entropy dissipation and `Phi_n`.
2. This is presented as a potential route to convexity/second-derivative control.

### C) Ranked strategies

1. **Computational certification** (highest-feasibility in response):
   - sparse SOS tooling (TSSOS),
   - SONC/SAGE alternatives,
   - symmetry reduction and subdivision.
2. **Score-function transfer** (conceptual all-`n` route):
   - finite analog of Blachman-Stam conditional expectation step.
3. **Heat-flow dissipation route**:
   - derive sign control from dynamical/entropy dissipation structure.

### D) `n=4` tactical advice from response

1. Apply symmetry reduction first.
2. Run sparse certification tooling before broader theoretical detours.
3. If full-domain certificate fails, use bounded subdivision to reduce to easier subproblems.

## Integration decision

1. Adopt as **planning input** for next cycle.
2. Do **not** treat as closure evidence.
3. Keep lane verdict unchanged until independently verified proof/certificate artifacts are generated.
