Lane: P04  
Integration intent: Archive latest P04 scout synthesis and route priorities for Claude Code execution.

## Response summary (core claims)

1. The finite free Fisher information inequality is presented as open in published literature.
2. Current `n=4` blocker is framed as polynomial-positivity certification (degree-34 / 1612-term object in one formulation; degree-14 / 837-term in another).
3. Top proposed closure routes:
   - computational certification (TSSOS/SONC/DSOS + symmetry reduction + subdivision),
   - finite score-function transfer (Blachman-Stam analog),
   - heat-flow / finite De Bruijn identity route.
4. Practical ranking in response favors computational certification first for `n=4`.

## Actionable extraction

1. Preserve P04 status as `BLOCKED_WITH_FRONTIER` unless proof-level certificate is produced.
2. Prioritize symmetry reduction + sparse certificate tooling over new broad theory construction.
3. Treat theoretical routes (score transfer, heat-flow dissipation) as secondary unless they produce a concrete finite identity.

## Integration notes

1. This transcript is scout input only; not theorem-level closure evidence.
2. Any external theorem statements from this intake require standard contamination logging before adoption in lane claims.
3. Existing lane facts (Session 18/19 state, proved subcases, blocker polynomial) remain unchanged until independently verified artifacts are produced.
