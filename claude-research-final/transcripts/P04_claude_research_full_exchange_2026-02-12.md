# Claude Research Full Exchange — P04

Date captured: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided Claude research transcript + response (manual paste)  
Lane: P04  
Purpose: Preserve both process-trace context and substantive mathematical output.

---

## 1) Main response artifact

The substantive response is archived verbatim at:
- `claude-research-final/transcripts/P04_claude_research_response_2026-02-12.md`

Top-line recommendations from that response:
1. Sparse SOS / Putinar via TSSOS on the 31-term degree-16 polynomial.
2. Finite analog of Shlyakhtenko–Tao projection/score argument.
3. Schur-complement lifting to isolate `b-c'` cross terms.

---

## 2) Process trace notes (as provided)

The supplied trace indicates:
1. full lane packet/context ingestion,
2. explicit blocker recognition (`n=4, b!=0` cross-terms),
3. multi-source research expansion,
4. ranked strategy synthesis.

The process trace also reports:
- “481 sources” consulted in ~8m23s.

## 3) Escalation/contamination interpretation

Because this run used broad external retrieval, treat it as high-escalation research input:
1. Do not import claims directly into theorem statements without primary-source verification.
2. Log each adopted theorem statement in contamination tracking with:
   - source,
   - UTC timestamp,
   - exact statement extracted,
   - risk rating,
   - integration decision.
3. Separate speculative strategy content from verified established results.

## 4) Integration status

- This transcript is archival/supporting context.
- It does not itself change P04 status.
- Status changes require checkable proof artifact or certificate.
