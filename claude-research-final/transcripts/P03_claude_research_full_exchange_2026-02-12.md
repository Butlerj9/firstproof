# Claude Research Full Exchange — P03

Date captured: 2026-02-12  
Source: User-provided transcript + response dump (manual paste)  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Preserve both the substantive mathematical output and the workflow/process trace for escalation audit.

## 1) Delivered mathematical output

Primary response is archived verbatim in:
- `claude-research-final/transcripts/P03_claude_research_response_2026-02-12.md`

It proposes 14 approach families and prioritizes:
1. Signed multiline queue q=1 combinatorial symmetry route.
2. PushTASEP reversibility/detailed-balance route (interpolation analogue).
3. Symmetric-subspace dimension-counting route after spectral collapse.

## 2) Process trace excerpt (as provided)

The transcript includes a staged research workflow with:
- lane packet ingestion and repeated context loading,
- targeted extraction of EXP-20 blockers,
- scouting/novelty framing against prior killed routes,
- a final synthesized research write-up.

Representative process lines from the provided transcript:

```text
The user has uploaded three files related to a mathematical research problem called "P03." Let me read these files to understand the context before deciding how to proceed.
...
Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the P03 problem. Let me now read the Kimi scout's three approaches more carefully since they were in the problem context file, then do my research.
...
I've now thoroughly reviewed all three files. This is a deep, well-documented mathematical research problem with a clear blocker. Let me launch a comprehensive research task focused on finding new approach families for the n≥5 Symmetry Conjecture closure.
...
Your research report on new mathematical routes to proving the interpolation Macdonald symmetry conjecture (P03) is ready.

## 3) Source-sensitivity note

The response references several recent/post-cutoff sources (including 2024–2026 papers and one forthcoming item `[BDW]`), so this exchange should be treated as **research-escalated** and requires citation contamination handling before core-lane integration.

Required per-source logging before integration into proofs:
1. Source identifier (arXiv DOI/URL).
2. UTC access time.
3. Exact extracted statement (theorem/lemma only).
4. Risk level (LOW/MED/HIGH).
5. Incorporation status (used/quarantined/rejected).

## 4) Integration status

- This file is archival-only.
- No theorem-level status change is implied by this transcript alone.
- Any adoption into `P03/answer.md` or `P03/audit.md` should be gated by a reproducible bridge-lemma attempt and explicit contamination log entries.
