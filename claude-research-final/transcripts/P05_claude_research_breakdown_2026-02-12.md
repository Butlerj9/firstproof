# Claude Research Breakdown — P05

Source: User-provided Claude research response  
Lane: P05  
Purpose: Extract bounded, executable next actions from the research report.

## 1) High-value signal

### Structural reframing
1. The Class II blocker is explicitly a non-uniform fixed-point-dimension issue for `ind_K^H(1)`.
2. The report frames the open problem as a comparison/equality of two t-structures in an O-slice setting.
3. It identifies a plausible bypass for tensor-ideal limitations using endomorphism-category reduction (Schwede–Shipley).

### Why this matters
- This shifts effort from repeated geometric-fixed-point slope heuristics to categorical detection machinery.
- It gives a concrete “what to prove next” target instead of broad heuristic searching.

---

## 2) Evidence-tier extraction

### Proved in lane context (unchanged)
- Theorems 1–7 and frontier theorem remain as currently documented.
- Class II “if” direction remains unresolved.

### Cited/proposed by new report (needs verification before integration)
- Carrick O-slice t-structure framing (high-risk contamination for direct framing relevance).
- Smith reconstruction conservativity for O-spectra.
- Stratification/detection analogs (MNN/Glasman/BHS family).
- Schwede–Shipley reduction as a possible route for non-tensor-ideal subcategories.

### Empirical/proposed
- “No counterexample found” in surveyed sources.
- Strategic suggestion: prove detection by reducing to module-category t-structure detection.

### Unresolved
- No theorem-level bridge lemma completed for Class II “if”.
- Tensor-ideal gap remains unresolved in lane artifacts.

## 3) Bounded route gate for next cycle

### Route A (primary): source-verified framing package
1. Verify exact theorem statements needed from Carrick/Smith/MNN/Glasman/Schwede–Shipley.
2. Build a minimal dependency graph of lemmas required for P05.
3. Produce a rigorous “usable vs non-usable” theorem extraction memo.

### Route B: endomorphism-category reduction pilot
1. Define generator set `S` for the relevant O-cell localizing subcategory in the smallest open case (`Z/4`).
2. Write explicit target equivalence form `Loc(S) ~ Mod-End(S)` in lane notation.
3. State precisely what fixed-point detection must prove in that module category.

### Route C: finite-case detection check in smallest open case
1. Compute/organize explicit fixed-point dimensions for the `Z/4` open case.
2. Test whether Hom-vanishing from generators can be certified subgroup-by-subgroup.
3. If not, record exact obstruction as a candidate lemma.

---

## 4) Stop-loss policy

1. If Route A fails to produce source-verified theorem extraction, do not proceed with abstract synthesis claims.
2. If Route B cannot be written with explicit lane objects/morphisms, mark as strategic only.
3. If Route C does not sharpen the obstruction into a precise lemma, stop cycle.
4. Keep P05 status unchanged unless a checkable bridge lemma is obtained.

---

## 5) Integration guidance

1. Add one escalation row to `P05/audit.md` if adopting this round.
2. Keep main proofs unchanged unless extracted statements are verified and integrated cleanly.
3. Update contamination logs before importing any high-risk framing claims.
