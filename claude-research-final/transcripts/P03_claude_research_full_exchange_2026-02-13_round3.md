# Claude Research Full Exchange — P03 (Round 3)

Date captured: 2026-02-13  
Source: User-provided response (manual paste)  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Preserve full intake context for audit/replay and downstream checklist synthesis.

## 1) Intake identity

The provided artifact starts with:

- `Symmetry of interpolation Macdonald corrections at q = 1`

and presents a full frontier certificate style write-up with:

1. lane verdict table,
2. failure map,
3. 14-route proposal set,
4. top-3 bridge lemmas + kill-tests,
5. contamination/escalation logging,
6. 48-hour execution plan.

---

## 2) Distinctive claims vs prior archived P03 rounds

1. Explicit emphasis on Sahi-Knop integrality as the limit/specialization well-definedness basis.
2. New top-3 route stack: BinAS / SMLQ / SSD.
3. Concrete kill-test order and stop-loss guidance for those 3.
4. Included code-style handoff snippets for immediate experimentation.

---

## 3) Integration decision

1. Archive as round-3 scout input.
2. Do not treat as theorem closure evidence.
3. Use for next P03 Claude Code checklist refinement:
   - prioritize D1 first,
   - keep D2/D3 as bounded follow-ons,
   - enforce strict stop-loss.

---

## 4) Lane hygiene notes

1. Preserve specialization-vs-limit disambiguation in all follow-up prompts/checklists.
2. Any source-level adoption into `P03/answer.md` requires contamination log alignment.
3. Keep verdict unchanged unless a checkable bridge lemma is actually proved.
