# Claude Research Full Exchange — P03 (Round 2)

Date captured: 2026-02-13  
Source: User-provided response (manual paste)  
Lane: P03  
Purpose: Preserve complete round-2 intake context for audit and downstream checklist generation.

## 1) Intake identity

The provided artifact is titled:
- `P03 Frontier Certificate v2: Interpolation Macdonald Symmetry Conjecture (n >= 5)`

This intake is distinct from the previously archived 2026-02-12 Claude Research P03 response.

## 2) Core claims captured

1. Critical correction restated:
   - At exact `q=1`, symmetric vanishing space dimension is `14` (EXP-5b),
   - therefore static `q=1` arguments that ignore limit selection are invalid for closure.
2. Status partition:
   - `n=2,3,4` proved,
   - `n>=5` blocked.
3. Route classification:
   - 12 prior failed routes,
   - 7 additional R1 routes killed by limit-selection filter,
   - 7 surviving routes with bridge-lemma targets.
4. Explicit 48-hour plan and contamination table included.

## 3) Integration decision

1. Archive as historical scout artifact.
2. Treat as planning input only (no theorem-level upgrade implied).
3. Use this intake to drive next P03 Claude Code checklist:
   - enforce limit-selection-aware route gating,
   - prioritize S1/S2 pilots (signed queue/tableaux),
   - keep S3/S4/S5/S6/S7 as staged follow-ons.

## 4) Notes for lane hygiene

1. This intake should not overwrite existing lane proofs for `n<=4`.
2. Any adopted external statement still needs contamination handling in lane docs before use.
3. Keep terminology explicit:
   - direct specialization at `q=1` vs
   - `q->1` limit-selected interpolation object used in current lane proof chain.
