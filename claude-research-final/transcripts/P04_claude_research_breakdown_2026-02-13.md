# Claude Research Breakdown — P04 (Round 2)

Source: User-provided Claude Research response  
Lane: P04  
Purpose: Distill execution signal for the next Claude Code cycle.

## 1) High-value signal

1. Main unresolved object is still a global positivity certificate for the remaining general `n=4` regime.
2. Proposed strongest near-term route is computational certification with sparsity/symmetry exploitation.
3. Structural routes are informative but currently high-risk without a new finite identity.

---

## 2) Priority stack from intake

1. **Primary**: TSSOS/SONC-style certification of the blocker polynomial(s), with symmetry reduction first.
2. **Secondary**: interval/CAD certification on normalized compact domain if SDP/SOCP routes stall.
3. **Tertiary**: score-function and heat-flow transfers only if a concrete, checkable finite lemma is obtained.

---

## 3) Immediate tasks implied

1. Build one canonical normalized inequality target and one exact domain definition (no notation drift).
2. Run certificate attempts in bounded order:
   - sparsity + symmetry reduction,
   - sparse SOS/SONC/DSOS,
   - subdomain subdivision + lower-dimensional checks.
3. Publish one of:
   - proof/certificate artifact (upgrade), or
   - exact irreducible unresolved remainder (frontier certificate).

---

## 4) Caveats

1. Scout claims about feasibility are directional, not proofs.
2. No status upgrade without checkable symbolic/certified artifact.
3. Keep contamination handling explicit for newly imported external statements.
